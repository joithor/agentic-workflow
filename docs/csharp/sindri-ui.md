# Sindri UI (C#): the app shell

The Sindri app is an [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) desktop app (readiness spec §4a "UI", `.agents/rules/csharp.md`
"The UI package"). Stage S1b ships its shell: one window that shows the control plane's status, the same status
`sindri status` prints, kept live from the event stream, and that says "Not running" with the fix when the control plane
is down. It is its own package, `SindriUi` (tier 4 in `deps.yaml`), and it holds no logic: every verdict comes from
Sindri's handlers (factory addendum §17.27.1). Nothing installs it before the switch.

## Shape

| Project | Holds |
|---|---|
| `src/Sindri/Aw.Sindri.Ui` | The views (`SindriApp`, `MainWindow`), the view model, the typed client of Sindri's HTTP API, and the ports for platform services |
| `src/Sindri/Aw.Sindri.Ui.Desktop` | The thin desktop head: `Main`, the composition and one adapter per port. NativeAOT binary `sindri-ui`. No views or view models |

- **No Sindri project reference.** The app reaches Sindri only through its HTTP contract (`docs/csharp/sindri.md`
  "Command layer and API"): `GET /sindri/ping`, `GET /sindri/status` and `GET /sindri/events`. `deps.yaml` declares it
  as the `SindriUi -> Sindri` **http** edge; `node scripts/check-deps.mjs` finds it as a string literal starting with
  Sindri's route prefix `/sindri/` in the app's C# projects, and fails on an undeclared or stale one.
- **Compiled bindings only.** `AvaloniaUseCompiledBindingsByDefault=true`, `x:DataType` on the window and every
  template, no `ReflectionBinding`, so the head publishes under NativeAOT.
- **View models carry no Avalonia types** (plain C#, `INotifyPropertyChanged`), so they test in the unit lane.
- **Hand composition, no container.** The app has one view model and one client; the head builds them by hand
  (`SindriApp.Create(records, clock)`). A service locator outside a Host would fail `ARCH-DI-001`.
- **Packages.** MIT Avalonia packages only, all `[12.1.3]`: `Avalonia`, `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent`, `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter`
  (the library), `Avalonia.Desktop` (the head), `Avalonia.Headless` and `Avalonia.Skia` (tests).

## How it finds the control plane

1. The endpoint-record port (`IEndpointRecordSource`) reads `control.json`. The desktop adapter reads it from
   `AW_SINDRI_HOME`, else `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri-app`, else `~/.agentic-workflow/sindri-app`, the same place the control
   plane writes it. No record means "Not running".
2. `GET /sindri/ping` must answer the record's pid **and** epoch; otherwise the record is stale and reads as "Not running".
3. `GET /sindri/status` fills the window. Each `/sindri/events` event (server-sent events, resumed from the last
   sequence seen) triggers one status refresh; a burst of events triggers one. When the stream ends (the control
   plane stopped or was killed), the app looks again, every 2 s while nothing answers.

## What the window shows

| Part | From the status record | Words |
|---|---|---|
| State pill | `running` | `Running`, `Not running` (with the reason and `sindri` as the fix), `Connecting` |
| Lease | `pid`, `epoch` | `pid 4242 · epoch 7`, and the API's `127.0.0.1:<port>` |
| Profile | `profile.approved`, `live`, `changedSinceApproval`, `problem`, `source` | `approved` · `changed since approval` · `not approved` · `unreadable`, with the hash and file |
| Profile fix | `profile.needsApproval` (Sindri's verdict; the app doesn't derive it) | `sindri profile approve` when set |
| Services | `services[]` | `heartbeat · every 5s · last run 12:00:05Z` (`not run yet`) |
| Last event | the newest stream event | `service.heartbeat · 12:00:05Z · #42` |

State is always a word, never colour alone; each status text carries an `AutomationProperties.Name`. The look follows
`docs/sindri/DESIGN.md`: the near-black canvas, charcoal cards with hairline borders, Inter, and the lavender accent only
on the brand mark and the state pill.

## Launching

Bare `sindri` opens the app after it starts (or finds) the control plane: the `sindri-ui` binary next to `sindri`, or
the one `AW_SINDRI_UI` names, started detached (`exec nohup`, no pipes to the terminal). The summary's `ui` line says
what happened: `opened (sindri-ui, pid N)`, or `not found at <path>` with the fix. `sindri --headless` opens nothing and
prints no `ui` line. Opening the app never changes `sindri`'s exit code. Each bare `sindri` opens a window; the app is
not single-instance yet.

## Errors

The app shows each as words in the window, never a dialog or a crash.

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `SND-UI-001` | No usable endpoint record, or it names a process that isn't the one answering |
| `SND-UI-002` | Nothing answered at the recorded endpoint, or not within 2 s |
| `SND-UI-003` | The API answered, but not with the record this build reads (an error status, or another body) |

## Tests

| Lane | What |
|---|---|
| unit | The view model against the in-memory API and endpoint record; the `ISindriApi` contract for the fake and for the real client over a canned handler that writes Sindri's wire format by hand; the control.json path |
| integration | The window under Avalonia's headless platform (Skia rendering; frames saved under the test output's `frames/`); the control.json adapter against a temp directory (the endpoint-record contract) |

`Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` 12.1.3 is compiled against xUnit v3 3.2.2 and fails discovery under the repo's xUnit v3 4.0.1
(`MissingMethodException` in `TestIntrospectionHelper.GetTestCaseDetails`). The view tests are plain xUnit v3 facts that
dispatch onto `HeadlessUnitTestSession.GetOrStartForAssembly(...)`, with the app builder in `[assembly:
AvaloniaTestApplication]`. Revisit when an `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` built against xUnit v3 4 is 14 days old.
