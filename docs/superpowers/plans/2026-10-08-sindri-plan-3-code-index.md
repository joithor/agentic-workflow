# Sindri Plan 3: Host Code Index Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the per-repo code index from spec §6.2 on the host. It has five layers: structure, clones, dependencies, local embeddings and a graphify graph. It also computes the shape signals ("reinvented?", "generalize at the second case?", "simpler?") on every commit in **record-only** mode, links each signal to what later happened to the flagged code (an outcome proxy, no hand labels), and reports per-type precision against the rollout step 3b bar. Then **switch it on** for this repo, so shape thresholds are calibrated on Sindri's own commits from Plan 4 onward (spec §13.3, row 7).

**Architecture:** A new `sindri/src/index/` module inside the Plan 2 package. Each layer is a builder that reads the repo's tracked files and writes tables in one SQLite file per repo, `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/index/<repo>.db`. Builds run under the box-wide heavy-job lock, write to a temp copy and swap it in atomically. Each layer has a version stamp, and a stamp mismatch rebuilds that layer. An hourly `--quick` build refreshes the cheap layers (structure, clones, deps); the nightly full build adds embeddings and the graph. Shape signals compare a per-commit **overlay** (the staged changes of the commit's own worktree, parsed in memory) against the base index. The git pre-commit hook opens the ledger read-only and records signals to a spool file; it is never a blocker. `observe` and `shape report` ingest the spool into the ledger, link each run to the commit that was actually made (by tree hash) and label its signals once they are old enough, so hooks never write a database (spec §5.2).

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.7 strict, ESM (Node16 resolution), Node >= 20, Vitest 2 with v8 coverage, Zod 3, better-sqlite3 13. The `typescript` compiler API parses code and is loaded lazily. Embeddings come from Ollama's `/api/embed` on loopback (`nomic-embed-text`). The graph comes from graphify (`graphifyy` on PyPI, installed with `uv` at a pinned, age-gated version, run as `graphify extract --code-only`), which runs under `sandbox-exec` on macOS or `bwrap --unshare-net` on Linux with the filesystem locked down.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md`. This plan implements §6.2 (code index, signals, offline guarantee, freshness, per-worktree overlay), the §11.3 index dependencies (`sindri index setup`), the `repo add`/`index` CLI rows of §10.3, the §11.5 `doctor` index checks, and §13.3 row 7 (record-only shape signals on ring 0). Enforcement (§6.2's enforced-outcome table, the Shape direction check) is rollout step 3b and is **not** in this plan.

**Depends on:** Plan 2 merged and switched on. This plan uses Plan 2's `Deps`, `COMMANDS`/`CommandDef`, `failure`/`SindriError`, `parseFlags`, the ledger (`migrateWith`, `withEpoch`), the tick lock, `approvedProfile`, `requireProfile`, `sanitizeName`, the scrubber, `runChecks`, and the pre-commit hook (`preCommitHook`, `hookBinary`).

## Spec amendments in this plan

Each is also edited into the spec in Task 12.

1. **The structure layer parses TypeScript and JavaScript with the TypeScript compiler API, not tree-sitter.** Both ring-0 (this repo) and the first ring-1 repo are TypeScript. The compiler API is exact for them, ships with a dependency the repo already has, and needs no native or WASM grammars. Other languages get the graph layer through graphify, which does use tree-sitter. A tree-sitter `Parser` adapter for further languages is a later plan, behind the same `Parser` interface.
2. **Embeddings call Ollama directly, and the egress control is more than a hostname check.** The Prism route (§6.2 "or Prism with `cloud_fallback:false`") is not built, which keeps one loopback endpoint to verify. The URL must be the IP literal `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` (not `localhost`, which the resolver can override) with no credentials; requests set `redirect: "error"`; the profile refuses an embedding model whose name contains `cloud` (those models forward text to a remote service). Node's `fetch` ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY` unless `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` is set, and `doctor` warns if it is. A loopback port that is really an SSH or port-forward tunnel is not "this machine"; that residual risk is documented, not detected.
3. **The graphify layer runs on a snapshot of the tracked files as checked out** (the working tree, copied to a temp dir, minus `index.denyPaths`, and only source and docs extensions), never on the working tree itself, because graphify writes `graphify-out/` into the directory it reads.
4. **The heavy-job lock is a `mkdir` lock at `$AW_STATE_DIR/locks/heavy`**, compatible with `config/lib/locks.sh` (same primitive, `rmdir` to release). The holder record (kind, pid, host, start time) sits beside it, so the lock dir stays empty for `rmdir`. A lock whose holder names a pid that is dead on this host is reclaimed, and the reclaim is recorded in the next holder's record.
5. **Shape signals in this plan are record-only and use deterministic layers inside the 2 s commit budget.** The embedding check runs only if the model answers within the remaining budget (the request is aborted at the budget), otherwise it's recorded as `deferred`. The graph layer's reinvention check uses the call sets the TypeScript parser extracts (and graphify's edges for other languages). Nothing blocks a commit until rollout step 3b. The hook opens the ledger read-only and never migrates it.
6. **Outcome labels are an outcome proxy, not human labels** (spec invariant 9: no hand labeling). Each run records `git write-tree` of the staged index; a reconcile step (in `observe` and `shape report`) maps the tree to the commit that was actually made, and once the commit is `shape.outcomeDays` (default 14) old labels each signal: `dropped` (the commit was never made, was amended, or never reached the default branch), `kept` (the flagged symbol or dependency is still there, unchanged), `acted-on` (it was later changed or removed), or `n/a` (diff size and export count have no flagged symbol). Precision per type and layer is `acted-on / (acted-on + kept)`: "the flagged code was later changed or removed" counts as the signal having been right. That is a proxy: code is also changed for unrelated reasons, and a signal can be right and ignored. The 3b bar (at least 30 labeled signals and precision at least 0.7 per layer) is read from `sindri shape report`.
7. **Index freshness.** An hourly `sindri index build --quick` refreshes structure, clones and deps (they finish in seconds), and the nightly build refreshes everything. Both read the files as checked out (the working tree), so keep `main` checked out in the indexed checkout; the per-repo bare mirror (created or refreshed by every full `index build`) is the source for a later plan. Each shape run records the index age.
8. **The graphify sandbox is network-deny plus filesystem lock-down, with a residual risk.** macOS: `(deny file-write*)` except the snapshot dir, the system temp dirs, `/dev` and `~/.cache`, and `(deny file-read*)` of `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.agentic-workflow` and `~/Library/Keychains`; Linux: a read-only root with the same dirs hidden behind tmpfs mounts. Everything else stays readable (the default allow-read): a compromised graphify could still read other files in the home directory and put them into `graph.json`. `graph.json` is size-capped and treated as untrusted. The process environment is cleared to `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG` and `TMPDIR`. `graphify` is installed with `uv tool install graphifyy==<pin> --exclude-newer <the pin's upload date>`, which also age-gates transitive dependencies.
9. **`sindri repo add` does not create the mirror.** It edits the live profile (atomically) and the `repos/<name>.yaml`; the change takes effect after `profile approve`. Every full `sindri index build` creates or refreshes the bare mirror of each approved repo at `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/mirrors/<name>.git`. A mirror holds the repo's full, unfiltered history (including deleted secrets and denied paths); it is mode 0700 and never mounted into a guest without a deny filter (decided before Plan 4 uses it). `index setup` reads the **approved** profile.
10. **`sindri index status` lists every repo.** A repo with no index is a row (`<repo>: no index (sindri index build --repo <repo>)`), not an `SND-INDEX-404` abort; the command exits 1 if any repo is missing or stale. `SND-INDEX-404` remains for `index query`.
11. **Switch-on may be degraded.** Row 7 switches on with structure, clones and deps `ok` and embeddings or graph `unavailable` (no Ollama, no uv, no sandbox); the PR evidence lists the layers that are down.

## Global Constraints

- Node >= 20, TypeScript 5.7 strict mode, ESM with Node16 module resolution (AGENTS.md Tech Stack).
- No `any` types. No `/* v8 ignore */` annotations. 100% line, function, branch and statement coverage in `sindri` (`npm run test:coverage`), and every task's tests cover the files that task touches. New coverage exclusions are only thin process wrappers named in a task (`src/index/sandbox-real.ts`), each with a smoke test.
- One heavy job at a time: `npm test`, typecheck and index builds run serially, once per commit (global CLAUDE.md). Index builds take the heavy-job lock themselves.
- **Offline guarantee (spec §6.2, T5):** index code never sends code off the machine. The embedding URL must be the loopback IP literal `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`, requests refuse redirects, and cloud-model names are refused, or the build refuses them. graphify runs with network denied and its filesystem locked down, and fails closed when that sandbox isn't available.
- Index inputs: tracked files only (`git ls-files`), minus `index.denyPaths` (matched case-insensitively). Symlinks are never followed. Per-file and total size caps apply (spec §6.2 Inputs). The staged overlay applies the same deny paths and the per-file cap. Symbol bodies are scrubbed before they are stored.
- Hooks never write the ledger or the index. The pre-commit hook opens the ledger read-only and writes a spool file; `observe` and `shape report` ingest it (spec §5.2).
- Record-only: `sindri shape --record` always exits 0 and never blocks a commit in this plan.
- Commands never read the clock, the environment or the process directly: they use `Deps` (`now`, `env`, `sleep`, `log`) and the injected `IndexIo` (`fetch`, `probes`).
- Core stays generic: no workplace names, labels, hosts or ticket prefixes in code, defaults or examples.
- Never write a full secret-shaped literal in any file; build test secrets by concatenation (Plan 2's pre-commit guard refuses them).
- Tick each step's checkbox (`- [x]`) in this plan file in the same commit that completes it.
- Commit format: `type: short description`, atomic commits, the session's attribution lines.

## Review Focus

1. **A file that changes between `git ls-files` and the read, or a tracked path that is now a symlink.** The inventory must skip it (lstat, regular files only), not follow it or crash. Pinned in Task 2.
2. **A build interrupted halfway (killed, out of disk).** The live index must stay the previous complete one, with no half-written tables. Builds write a temp copy and rename it. Pinned in Task 5.
3. **Ollama down, the model missing, a redirect, a cloud model, or a non-loopback URL in the profile.** The embeddings layer must report `unavailable` with a reason and leave the other layers built and usable; a non-loopback URL is refused before any request. Pinned in Tasks 1 and 6.
4. **graphify missing, sandbox missing, or graphify trying the network or reading the home directory's secrets.** The graph layer fails closed (`unavailable`) and the other layers still build. Pinned in Task 7.
5. **A commit touching only non-code files, a deleted file, a rename, or a huge generated file.** `shape --record` must finish under the budget, record nothing spurious, and exit 0. Pinned in Tasks 8 and 9.
6. **A commit from a linked worktree, and a hook that must not write the ledger.** The hook diffs the commit's own worktree, matches the profile repo by git common dir, and leaves the ledger bytes unchanged. Pinned in Task 9.
7. **A signal that can never be labeled (commit amended, never merged, index missing).** Reconcile must label it `dropped` or leave it unlabeled, never mislabel it, and precision must be computed only from `acted-on` and `kept`. Pinned in Task 10.

### Task 1: Profile keys, ledger migration v2, read-only ledger open, injected I/O types and the heavy-job lock

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/io.ts`, `sindri/src/index/loopback.ts`, `sindri/src/index/heavy-lock.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/profile/schema.ts` (add `index`, `shape`; repo `index`), `sindri/src/ledger/db.ts` (append migration v2, add `openLedgerReadOnly`), `sindri/src/deps.ts` (add `sleep`, `log`), `sindri/src/cli.ts`, `sindri/tests/helpers.ts`, `sindri/src/errors.ts`
- Test: `sindri/tests/index-profile.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/heavy-lock.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ProfileSchema`, `RepoSchema`, `SizeSchema` (Plan 2 Task 5); `migrateWith`/`MIGRATIONS`, `openLedger`, `schemaVersion` (Plan 2 Task 3); `Deps`, `awStateDir` (Plan 2 Task 1); `SystemProbe.hostname/pid/pidAlive` (Plan 2 Task 4).
- Produces:
  - `isLoopbackUrl(url: string): boolean` — true only for `http(s)://127.0.0.1|[::1][:port]` with no credentials (not `localhost`).
  - Profile keys (all with defaults): `index.{denyPaths, utilityGlobs, maxFileKB, maxTotalMB, maxAgeHours, embeddings.{enabled, url, model}, graph}` and `shape.{record, budgetMs, outcomeDays, defaultSize, thresholds.{nameSimilarity, embedding, embeddingAst, nearCloneTokens, nearCloneJaccard, callOverlap, complexityDelta}, sizeBudget.{XS..XL}, exportAllowance.{XS..XL}}`; repo key `index.denyPaths` (added to the profile's). An embedding model whose name contains `cloud` is refused.
  - Ledger v2 tables `shape_runs` and `shape_signals` (schema in Step 3), including the outcome columns (`tree`, `commit_sha`, `name`, `ast_hash`, `outcome`, `labeled_at`).
  - `openLedgerReadOnly(file: string): Ledger | null` — readonly, no pragmas, no migration; `null` when the file is missing or its `user_version` differs from `LEDGER_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
  - `Deps.sleep(ms: number): Promise<void>` and `Deps.log(line: string): void` (progress lines to stderr; a no-op in tests unless a test captures them).
  - `io.ts` types: `FetchLike`, `ProcessRunner`, `IndexProbes`, `IndexIo` (Step 3).
  - `withHeavyLock<T>(deps, kind: string, timeoutMs: number, fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>` — throws `SND-INDEX-001` when busy after `timeoutMs`, reclaims a lock whose holder pid is dead on this host (logged, and recorded in the new holder's `reclaimed` field), logs `waiting for the heavy-job lock (...)` once; `heavyLockState(stateRoot: string, now: () => Date): { held: boolean; holder: HeavyHolder | null; ageMs: number | null }`; `heavyLockDir(stateRoot): string`. `HeavyHolder = { kind; pid; host; startedAt; reclaimed: string | null }`.

- [ ] **Step 0: Preflight Plan 2's names**

This plan builds on Plan 2's exact names. Check them before writing anything:

```bash
cd sindri && for s in "export function openLedger" "export function migrateWith" "export function withEpoch" "export function schemaVersion" "export function approvedProfile" "export function requireProfile" "export function sanitizeName" "export function resolveProfileRoot" "export async function runChecks" "export function preCommitHook" "export function hookBinary" "export function acquireTickLock" "export function makeScrubber" "export function parseFlags" "export function realGitRunner" "export function inspectLock"; do grep -rq "$s" src || echo "MISSING: $s"; done; echo preflight done
```

Expected: only `preflight done`. A `MISSING:` line means Plan 2 shipped under a different name: stop, list the mismatches, and amend this plan before going on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `sindri/tests/helpers.ts`, add `sleep: async () => undefined, log: () => undefined,` to the object `makeDeps` returns (before `...overrides`). Those two spots (`makeDeps` and `cli.ts`) are the only places that build a whole `Deps`; every other test spreads `makeDeps()`. `npm run typecheck` flags any other.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/index-profile.test.ts tests/heavy-lock.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../src/index/loopback.js` (and `../src/index/heavy-lock.js`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`sindri/src/index/io.ts` (types only: every command takes its machine access through these, so tests inject fakes):

```ts
// `redirect: "error"`: the embedding endpoint is loopback; a redirect would send code elsewhere.
export type FetchLike = (
  url: string,
  init: { method: "POST"; headers: Record<string, string>; body: string; signal: AbortSignal; redirect: "error" },
) => Promise<{ ok: boolean; status: number; json(): Promise<unknown> }>;

export interface ProcessRunner {
  // cleanEnv: run with only PATH, HOME, LANG and TMPDIR (graphify never sees tokens).
  run(argv: string[], o: { cwd: string; timeoutMs: number; cleanEnv?: boolean }): Promise<{ code: number; stdout: string; stderr: string }>;
}

// What `index setup` and `doctor` need from the machine. Real: sandbox-real.ts.
export interface IndexProbes {
  has(bin: string): boolean;
  run: ProcessRunner["run"];
  getJson(url: string, timeoutMs: number): Promise<unknown | null>;
}

export interface IndexIo {
  fetch: FetchLike;
  probes: IndexProbes;
}
```

`sindri/src/index/loopback.ts`:

```ts
// Spec §6.2 offline guarantee: the embedding endpoint must be this machine. Only the
// IP literals count: `localhost` goes through the system resolver, which can be overridden.
export function isLoopbackUrl(url: string): boolean {
  let u: URL;
  try {
    u = new URL(url);
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
  if (u.protocol !== "http:" && u.protocol !== "https:") return false;
  if (u.username !== "" || u.password !== "") return false;
  return u.hostname === "127.0.0.1" || u.hostname === "[::1]";
}
```

In `sindri/src/profile/schema.ts`, add before `export const ProfileSchema`:

  })
  .strict()
  .default({})
  .describe("Shape signals (spec §6.2)");
```

Add `import { isLoopbackUrl } from "../index/loopback.js";` at the top, and the keys `index: IndexSchema,` and `shape: ShapeSchema,` to the `ProfileSchema` object (after `scrub`). In `RepoSchema`, add after `overrides`:

```ts
    index: z.object({ denyPaths: z.array(z.string().min(1)).default([]) }).strict().default({}).describe("index.denyPaths for this repo, added to the profile's"),
```

In `sindri/src/ledger/db.ts`, append to `MIGRATIONS` (never edit entry 0):

```ts
  `

    run_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    repo TEXT NOT NULL,

  );
  CREATE INDEX shape_signals_type ON shape_signals(type);
  CREATE INDEX shape_signals_run ON shape_signals(run_id);
  `,
```

and, after `openLedger` in the same file:

```ts
// The pre-commit hook's open (spec §5.2: hooks never write the ledger): no pragmas, no
// migration, no WAL switch. A missing file or a schema version this build doesn't know is null.
export function openLedgerReadOnly(file: string): Ledger | null {

    return null;

```

In `sindri/src/deps.ts`, add the fields `sleep: (ms: number) => Promise<void>;` and `log: (line: string) => void;`. In `sindri/src/cli.ts`, pass:

```ts
  sleep: (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms)),
  log: (line) => process.stderr.write(`${line}\n`),
```

Add to `ERRORS`:

```ts
  "SND-INDEX-001": { summary: "The heavy-job lock is busy.", fix: "wait for the holder to finish; `sindri doctor` shows it" },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npm run gen && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS (Plan 2's `profile-doc` test passes after `npm run gen` regenerates `profile.md` and the schemas); 100% coverage.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests sindri/schema docs/sindri
git commit -m "feat: sindri index and shape profile keys, ledger v2, heavy-job lock"
```

### Task 2: Path globs and the tracked-file inventory

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/globs.ts`, `sindri/src/index/files.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/errors.ts` (add `SND-INDEX-002`, `SND-INDEX-003`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/globs.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/files.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `GitRunner` (Plan 2 Task 6); `SindriError` (Plan 2 Task 1).
- Produces:
  - `globToRegExp(glob: string): RegExp` — case-insensitive (`.ENV` on a case-insensitive filesystem is still `.env*`); `**/` matches zero or more directories, a trailing `**` anything, `*` anything within one segment, `?` one character; `matchesAny(p: string, globs: readonly string[]): boolean`.
  - `interface IndexedFile { path: string; hash: string; size: number; text: string }` (`hash` = sha256 hex of the bytes).
  - `type SkipReason = "denied" | "symlink" | "not-a-file" | "too-large" | "unreadable"`.
  - `inventory(git: GitRunner, repoPath: string, o: { denyPaths: readonly string[]; maxFileKB: number; maxTotalMB: number; select: (p: string) => boolean }): Promise<{ files: IndexedFile[]; skipped: { path: string; reason: SkipReason }[] }>` — tracked files only, sorted by path; throws `SND-INDEX-002` outside a git repo and `SND-INDEX-003` past `maxTotalMB`.
  - `isSourcePath(p: string): boolean` — `.ts .tsx .mts .cts .js .jsx .mjs .cjs`, not `.d.ts`; `isGraphInput(p: string): boolean` — the extensions graphify may read (source in the languages it parses, plus `.md`), so data files, configs and lockfiles never reach it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

### Task 3: TypeScript structure parser (symbols, normalized AST hash, complexity, callees)

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/parse-ts.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/package.json` (move `typescript` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/parse-ts.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/parse-ts-lazy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  interface ParsedSymbol {
    name: string;            // "foo", "Store.save", or "default"
    kind: "function" | "method" | "arrow" | "class";
    file: string;
    startLine: number;       // 1-based
    endLine: number;
    exported: boolean;
    signature: string;       // "(a: string, b = 1): Promise<void>", whitespace collapsed; "" for classes
    astHash: string;         // sha256 of the normalized token sequence of the whole node
    tokens: string[];        // node kinds; identifiers → "$id", literals → "$lit"
    complexity: number;      // 1 + decision points
    callees: string[];       // sorted unique names this symbol calls
    text: string;            // source text, capped at 4000 characters
  }
  interface Parser { supports(p: string): boolean; parse(file: string, text: string): ParsedSymbol[] }
  const typescriptParser: Parser;
  ```
  Renaming identifiers or changing literals doesn't change `astHash`; changing structure does. That is what "clone" means in §6.2. The `typescript` module is loaded on the first `parse` call, not at import (`sindri --help`, `observe` and the hook's `scrub --staged` never pay for it).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

### Task 4: MinHash signatures and LSH bands

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/minhash.ts`
- Test: `sindri/tests/minhash.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `SHINGLE = 5`, `PERMS = 64`, `BANDS = 16` (`ROWS = 4` per band).
  - `shingles(tokens: string[], k?: number): Set<string>` — `k`-token windows; a sequence shorter than `k` gives one shingle of the whole sequence.
  - `signature(tokens: string[]): Uint32Array` — 64 minimums of seeded FNV-1a hashes over the shingles.
  - `bandKeys(sig: Uint32Array): string[]` — 16 keys `"<band>:<hex>"`; two signatures that share any key are LSH candidates (no pairwise comparison, spec §6.2).
  - `estimateJaccard(a: Uint32Array, b: Uint32Array): number`; `jaccard(a: Set<string>, b: Set<string>): number` (exact).
  - `encodeSig(sig): Buffer` / `decodeSig(buf): Uint32Array` for SQLite blobs.

### Task 5: Index database, dependency layer, incremental build, mirror and `sindri index build|status`

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/db.ts`, `sindri/src/index/deps-layer.ts`, `sindri/src/index/build.ts`, `sindri/src/index/mirror.ts`, `sindri/src/index/commands.ts`, `sindri/src/index/sandbox-real.ts`, `sindri/tests/index-fixtures.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/profile/approve.ts` (add `requireApprovedProfile`), `sindri/src/main.ts` (register `index`), `sindri/src/errors.ts`, `sindri/tests/helpers.ts` (add `git`, `gitRepo`), `sindri/vitest.config.ts` (exclude `sandbox-real.ts`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/index-db.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/deps-layer.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/index-build.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/real.test.ts` (smoke)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `inventory`, `isSourcePath` (Task 2); `typescriptParser`, `ParsedSymbol` (Task 3); `signature`, `bandKeys`, `encodeSig` (Task 4); `withHeavyLock`, `IndexIo` (Task 1); `matchesAny` (Task 2); `approvedProfile`, `LoadedProfile` (Plan 2); `makeScrubber`, `compileExtraPatterns` (Plan 2 Task 2); `ulid` (Plan 2).
- Produces (`db.ts`):
  - `INDEX_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`; `indexPath(deps, repo: string): string` → `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/index/<repo>.db`.
  - `openIndex(file): IndexDb` — creates the schema; a file with another `user_version` is emptied and recreated (the index is derived data, so it's rebuilt, never migrated). `openIndexReadOnly(file): IndexDb | null` — `null` when the file is missing or has another `user_version`.
  - `LAYERS` (`as const`), `type Layer`; `type LayerStatus = "ok" | "unavailable" | "disabled" | "pending"` (`pending`: a quick build ran before the first full one).
  - Reader functions: `layers(db)`, `meta(db)` (`{ commit: string; builtAt: string | null }`, `commit` is `""` when unset), `symbolsByAstHash(db, hash)`, `allSymbols(db)`, `bandCandidates(db, keys: string[])`, `depRows(db)`, `embeddingRows(db, model)`, `graphEdges(db)`. Row type `SymbolRow` = `ParsedSymbol` minus `tokens`/`text`, plus `id`, `utility: boolean`, `tokenCount`, `minhash: Uint32Array`, `callees: string[]` (no body: bodies stay in the db for embeddings only).
- Produces (`deps-layer.ts`): `PURPOSE_TAGS: Record<string, readonly string[]>`; `tagsFor(name: string): string[]`; `readManifestDeps(manifest: string, text: string): DepRow[]` with `DepRow { manifest; name; version; kind: "prod" | "dev" | "peer"; tags: string[] }`.
- Produces (`build.ts`):
  - `INDEXER_VERSION = "1"`.
  - `interface Providers { embedder: Embedder | null; graph: GraphProvider | null }` (the interfaces arrive in Tasks 6 and 7; this task declares them as `null`-only placeholders: `type Embedder = never; type GraphProvider = never` in `build.ts`, replaced there).
  - `buildIndex(deps, loaded: LoadedProfile, repo: string, o: { full: boolean; quick?: boolean }, providers: Providers): Promise<BuildReport>` with `BuildReport { repo; commit: string | null; quick: boolean; files: { indexed: number; changed: number; removed: number; skipped: number }; symbols: number; layers: Record<Layer, { status: LayerStatus; detail: string }>; ms: number }`. With `quick`, the embeddings and graph layers are skipped entirely and their rows left untouched (`pending` on a fresh index). The structure stamp includes a hash of `index.utilityGlobs`, stored symbol bodies are scrubbed, and temp copies older than an hour are swept.
- Produces (`mirror.ts`): `mirrorPath(deps, name)`; `refreshMirror(deps, name, repoPath): Promise<string>` — creates or refreshes the bare mirror at `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/mirrors/<name>.git` (mode 0700 dir; `SND-INDEX-002` when git fails).
- Produces (`commands.ts`): `makeIndexCommand(io: IndexIo): Command` with `build [--repo NAME] [--quick] [--full] [--json]` and `status [--repo NAME] [--json]`; `query` and `setup` arrive in Tasks 8 and 11. `approvedOrThrow(deps): LoadedProfile`.
- Produces (`sandbox-real.ts`, coverage-excluded, smoke-tested): `realProcessRunner()`, `hasBinary(bin)`, `realIndexProbes()`, `realIndexIo()`.
- Produces (`approve.ts`): `requireApprovedProfile(deps, db): LoadedProfile` — throws `SND-PROFILE-012` when nothing is approved.
- Produces (`tests/helpers.ts`): `git(cwd, ...args): string` (fixed author, committer date `2026-10-08T12:00:00+00:00`); `gitRepo(files): string` — a temp repo, branch `main`, with those files committed.
- Produces (`tests/index-fixtures.ts`): `OFF`, `fakeIndexIo(over?)`, `ring0Repo(files)`, `approvedIndexDeps(root, o?)`, `ring0Name(d)`, `profileFor(root, o?)`, `BODY(name, extra?)`, `METHOD(cls, key)`, `failingGit(...needles)`, `embedFetch(vec?)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `sindri/tests/helpers.ts`, add (the file already imports `fs` and `path`):

```ts
import { execFileSync } from "node:child_process";

export const COMMIT_DATE = "2026-10-08T12:00:00+00:00";

Register in `sindri/src/main.ts`:

```ts
import { makeIndexCommand } from "./index/commands.js";
import { realIndexIo } from "./index/sandbox-real.js";

  index: {
    summary: "Build and inspect the per-repo code index",
    usage: [
      "Usage:",
      "  sindri index build [--repo NAME] [--quick] [--full] [--json]",
      "  sindri index status [--repo NAME] [--json]   (exit 1 when an index is missing or stale)",
      "  sindri index query <name> [--repo NAME] [--json]",
      "  sindri index setup [--dry-run] [--json]",
    ].join("\n"),
    run: makeIndexCommand(realIndexIo()),
  },
```

(`query` and `setup` land in Tasks 8 and 11; until then they report an unknown subcommand.)

Add to `ERRORS`:

```ts
  "SND-PROFILE-012": { summary: "No profile has been approved yet.", fix: "sindri profile approve" },
  "SND-INDEX-404": { summary: "No index has been built for this repo.", fix: "sindri index build" },
```

`files.indexed` counts every inventoried file (sources and manifests); `changed` and `removed` count source files. The mirror is created or refreshed by full builds before the index build; a `--quick` build skips it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npm run gen && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS; 100% coverage (`sandbox-real.ts` is excluded and covered by its smoke tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests sindri/vitest.config.ts docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri code index database, dependency layer, incremental build and mirror"
```

### Task 6: Embeddings layer (Ollama on loopback only)

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/embed.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/index/build.ts` (real `Embedder` type, `embedLayer`), `sindri/src/index/commands.ts` (`embedderFor`, pass it to `buildIndex`), `sindri/src/errors.ts`
- Test: `sindri/tests/embed.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/index-build.test.ts` (embedding cases)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isLoopbackUrl` (Task 1); `FetchLike`, `IndexIo` (Task 1); `IndexDb`, `setLayer`, `stampOf` (Task 5, module-private in `build.ts`).
- Produces (`embed.ts`):
  - `interface Embedder { model: string; embed(texts: string[], o?: { timeoutMs?: number }): Promise<Float32Array[]> }` — each request aborts at `min(o.timeoutMs, the embedder's own timeout)`.
  - `makeOllamaEmbedder(o: { url: string; model: string; fetch: FetchLike; timeoutMs?: number }): Embedder` — throws `SND-INDEX-005` for a non-loopback URL **before** any request; every request sets `redirect: "error"`; request errors throw `SND-INDEX-006`.
  - `embeddingText(s: { name: string; signature: string; body: string }): string` (≤ 2000 characters); `encodeVec(v: Float32Array): Buffer`; `decodeVec(b: Buffer): Float32Array`; `cosine(a: Float32Array, b: Float32Array): number`.
- Produces (`build.ts`): `Embedder` is now the real interface; the embeddings layer is `ok` (stamp `<model>@<INDEXER_VERSION>`), `disabled` (no embedder) or `unavailable` (with the error text). Only symbols without a vector for the current model are embedded; a model change re-embeds everything. Classes are not embedded. A `--quick` build never calls the embedder.
- Produces (`commands.ts`): `embedderFor(loaded: LoadedProfile, io: IndexIo): Embedder | null`.

```

In `sindri/src/index/build.ts`:
- Replace `export type Embedder = never;` with `export type { Embedder } from "./embed.js";` and add `import { embeddingText, encodeVec, type Embedder } from "./embed.js";`.
- Add this function after `writeDeps`:

```ts
async function embedLayer(db: IndexDb, embedder: Embedder | null, now: Date): Promise<void> {
  if (embedder === null) {
    setLayer(db, "embeddings", "none", "disabled", "no embedder configured", now);
    return;
  }
  const stamp = `${embedder.model}@${INDEXER_VERSION}`;
  const previous = stampOf(db, "embeddings");
  if (previous !== stamp) db.exec("DELETE FROM embeddings");
  const todo = db
    .prepare("SELECT s.id, s.name, s.signature, s.body FROM symbols s LEFT JOIN embeddings e ON e.symbol_id = s.id WHERE e.symbol_id IS NULL AND s.kind != 'class' ORDER BY s.id")
    .all() as { id: number; name: string; signature: string; body: string }[];
  try {
    const vectors = await embedder.embed(todo.map(embeddingText));
    db.transaction(() => {
      todo.forEach((s, i) => db.prepare("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO embeddings (symbol_id, model, vector) VALUES (?, ?, ?)").run(s.id, embedder.model, encodeVec(vectors[i])));
    })();
    setLayer(db, "embeddings", stamp, "ok", `${embedder.model} on loopback`, now);
  } catch (e) {
    // The other layers stay usable; the next build retries (Review Focus 3).
    setLayer(db, "embeddings", previous ?? "none", "unavailable", (e as Error).message, now);
  }
}
```

- In `buildIndex`, in the non-quick `else` branch, replace the line `setLayer(db, "embeddings", "none", "disabled", "no embedder configured", now);` with `await embedLayer(db, providers.embedder, now);`.

In `sindri/src/index/commands.ts`, add `import { makeOllamaEmbedder, type Embedder } from "./embed.js";` and:

```ts
export function embedderFor(loaded: LoadedProfile, io: IndexIo): Embedder | null {
  const e = loaded.profile.index.embeddings;
  return e.enabled ? makeOllamaEmbedder({ url: e.url, model: e.model, fetch: io.fetch }) : null;
}
```

and in `build`, rename the parameter `_io` to `io` and replace the `buildIndex(...)` line with:

```ts
    reports.push(await buildIndex(deps, loaded, repo, { full: values.full === true, quick }, { embedder: embedderFor(loaded, io), graph: null }));
```

(`embedderFor` also refuses a bad URL before any work starts; a quick build constructs the embedder but `buildIndex` never calls it.)

Add to `ERRORS`:

```ts
  "SND-INDEX-005": { summary: "The embedding URL is not loopback.", fix: "set index.embeddings.url to http://127.0.0.1:11434 (or disable embeddings)" },
  "SND-INDEX-006": { summary: "The local embedding server failed.", fix: "sindri index setup (starts Ollama checks and pulls the model)" },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npm run gen && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS; 100% coverage.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri embeddings layer on a loopback-only Ollama"
```

### Task 7: Graph layer (graphify in a locked-down, network-less sandbox)

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/graph.ts`, `sindri/src/index/pins.ts`, `sindri/tests/fixtures/graphify/graph.json` (recorded in Step 1)
- Modify: `sindri/package.json` (`sindri.graphifyPin`, `sindri.graphifyPinDate`), `sindri/src/index/build.ts` (real `GraphProvider`, `graphLayer`), `sindri/src/index/commands.ts` (`graphFor`), `sindri/src/errors.ts`
- Test: `sindri/tests/graph.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/pins.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/real.test.ts` (sandbox smoke), `sindri/tests/index-build.test.ts` (graph cases)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `inventory`, `isGraphInput` (Task 2); `ProcessRunner`, `IndexIo` (Task 1); `IndexDb`, `setLayer`, `stampOf` (Task 5); `hasBinary` (Task 5).
- Produces (`graph.ts`):
  - `interface GraphData { nodes: { id: string; file: string | null; name: string | null; line: number | null }[]; edges: { src: string; dst: string; relation: string; confidence: string }[] }`.
  - `interface GraphProvider { version: string; build(snapshotDir: string): Promise<GraphData> }`.
  - `sandboxArgv(platform: NodeJS.Platform, argv: string[], has: (bin: string) => boolean, o: { writable: string[]; home: string }): string[] | null` — macOS: `sandbox-exec -p '<profile>'` with network denied, writes denied except `writable`, the system temp dirs, `/dev` and `~/.cache`, and reads of `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.agentic-workflow` and `~/Library/Keychains` denied; Linux: `bwrap --ro-bind / / --dev /dev --proc /proc --tmpfs /tmp --bind <w> <w> … --tmpfs <home>/.ssh … --unshare-net --unshare-pid --die-with-parent`; `null` otherwise (fail closed). Paths are escaped (`"` and `\`).
  - `parseGraphJson(text: string): GraphData` — NetworkX node-link (`nodes`, and `links` or `edges`); field names are read from candidate lists, so a graphify release that renames `source_file` → `file` keeps working; anything that is not a JSON object is `SND-INDEX-008`.
  - `makeGraphifyProvider(o: { bin: string; version: string; runner: ProcessRunner; platform: NodeJS.Platform; has: (bin: string) => boolean; home: string }): GraphProvider` — runs `graphify extract <snapshot> --code-only --no-viz` sandboxed with a cleaned environment; throws `SND-INDEX-007` with no sandbox, `SND-INDEX-008` when graphify is not installed, fails, writes no `graph.json`, or writes one over 32 MB.
- Produces (`pins.ts`): `GRAPHIFY_PIN`, `GRAPHIFY_PIN_DATE` — the graphifyy version `index setup` installs and `doctor` expects, and its PyPI upload time (read from the `sindri` key of `sindri/package.json`, written in Step 1).
- Produces (`build.ts`): the graph layer runs on a **snapshot** of tracked, non-denied source and docs files written to a temp dir (spec amendment 3), only when the inputs' digest changed, the stamp changed, or there is no graph yet (so a `--quick` build that absorbed a change doesn't hide it from the next full build); `ok` (stamp `graphify@<version>`), `disabled` or `unavailable`.
- Produces (`commands.ts`): `graphFor(loaded: LoadedProfile, deps: Deps, io: IndexIo): GraphProvider | null`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Install graphify at an age-gated pin, and record a real `graph.json` fixture**

`graphifyy` is a Python package; install it with `uv` (required, no `pipx` path). First confirm the package name and the flags this plan builds on:

```bash
uv tool run --from graphifyy graphify --help | head -20
uv tool run --from graphifyy graphify extract --help | grep -e '--code-only' -e '--no-viz'
```

Expected: a help text, and both flags listed. If the name or a flag is different, stop and amend this task; don't improvise.

Pick the pin deterministically: the newest release at least 14 days old (on Linux use `date -u -d '14 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` in place of the `-v-14d` form):

```bash
read -r PIN PIN_DATE < <(curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/graphifyy/json | jq -r --arg cut "$(date -u -v-14d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)" '.releases | to_entries | map(select((.value | length) > 0 and .value[0].upload_time_iso_8601 < $cut)) | sort_by(.value[0].upload_time_iso_8601) | last | "\(.key) \(.value[0].upload_time_iso_8601)"')
echo "pin $PIN uploaded $PIN_DATE"
```

Expected: one line such as `pin 0.4.2 uploaded 2026-09-01T10:15:30.123456Z`. Install exactly that release, with `--exclude-newer` so its transitive dependencies are age-gated to the same date, and check the CLI reports it:

```bash
uv tool install "graphifyy==$PIN" --exclude-newer "$PIN_DATE"
graphify --version | grep -F "$PIN" && echo PIN_OK
(cd sindri && npm pkg set "sindri.graphifyPin=$PIN" "sindri.graphifyPinDate=$PIN_DATE")
```

Expected: `PIN_OK`, and `sindri/package.json` gains a `sindri` object with both keys. Now record the fixture from a tiny two-file repo, running graphify the way the code does (network denied, filesystem locked down; the snapshot dir is the only writable path):

```bash
FIX="$(mktemp -d)"; FIXREAL="$(cd "$FIX" && pwd -P)"
printf 'export function a() { return b(); }\nimport { b } from "./b";\n' > "$FIX/a.ts"
printf 'export function b() { return 1; }\n' > "$FIX/b.ts"
PROFILE="(version 1)(allow default)(deny network*)(deny file-write*)(allow file-write* (subpath \"$FIXREAL\") (subpath \"/private/var/folders\") (subpath \"/private/tmp\") (subpath \"/dev\") (subpath \"$HOME/.cache\"))(deny file-read* (subpath \"$HOME/.ssh\") (subpath \"$HOME/.aws\") (subpath \"$HOME/.gnupg\") (subpath \"$HOME/.agentic-workflow\") (subpath \"$HOME/Library/Keychains\"))"
env -i PATH="$PATH" HOME="$HOME" LANG="${LANG:-C}" TMPDIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}" sandbox-exec -p "$PROFILE" graphify extract "$FIX" --code-only --no-viz
mkdir -p sindri/tests/fixtures/graphify
sed -e "s|$FIXREAL|/snapshot|g" -e "s|$FIX|/snapshot|g" "$FIX/graphify-out/graph.json" > sindri/tests/fixtures/graphify/graph.json
jq '{nodes: (.nodes | length), links: ((.links // .edges) | length), node_keys: (.nodes[0] | keys), link_keys: ((.links // .edges)[0] | keys)}' sindri/tests/fixtures/graphify/graph.json
```

Expected: at least 2 nodes and 1 link. If graphify fails because the sandbox forbids a path it needs, stop and add that single path to the profile in Step 4 (and here); don't loosen the profile otherwise. Note the printed `node_keys` and `link_keys`. If a key that names the file, the symbol name, the line, the relation or the confidence is not already in `parseGraphJson`'s candidate lists (Step 4), add it there. Don't rename the fixture's keys. The fixture holds `/snapshot` in place of the temp path, so no machine-specific path is committed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

```ts

```

In `sindri/src/index/build.ts`:
- Replace `export type GraphProvider = never;` with `export type { GraphProvider } from "./graph.js";` and add `import type { GraphProvider } from "./graph.js";` and `import os from "node:os";`. Change the files import to `import { inventory, isGraphInput, isSourcePath, type IndexedFile } from "./files.js";`.
- Add after `embedLayer`:

```ts
async function graphLayer(
  db: IndexDb, provider: GraphProvider | null, deps: Deps, repoPath: string, deny: string[], digest: string, ix: LoadedProfile["profile"]["index"], now: Date,
): Promise<void> {
  if (provider === null) {
    setLayer(db, "graph", "none", "disabled", "no graph provider configured", now);
    return;
  }
  const stamp = `graphify@${provider.version}`;
  const hasGraph = (db.prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) AS n FROM graph_nodes").get() as { n: number }).n > 0;
  const stored = (db.prepare("SELECT value FROM meta WHERE key = 'graph_digest'").get() as { value: string } | undefined)?.value;
  if (stored === digest && stampOf(db, "graph") === stamp && hasGraph) return;
  // Snapshot of tracked, non-denied source and docs files: graphify writes graphify-out/ into the
  // directory it reads, so it never runs on the working tree (spec amendment 3).
  const snap = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "sindri-graph-"));
  try {
    const inv = await inventory(deps.git, repoPath, { denyPaths: deny, maxFileKB: ix.maxFileKB, maxTotalMB: ix.maxTotalMB, select: isGraphInput });
    for (const f of inv.files) {
      fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(path.join(snap, f.path)), { recursive: true });
      fs.writeFileSync(path.join(snap, f.path), f.text);
    }
    const g = await provider.build(snap);
    db.transaction(() => {
      db.exec("DELETE FROM graph_nodes; DELETE FROM graph_edges;");
      for (const n of g.nodes) db.prepare("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO graph_nodes (id, file, name, line) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)").run(n.id, n.file, n.name, n.line);
      for (const e of g.edges) db.prepare("INSERT INTO graph_edges (src, dst, relation, confidence) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)").run(e.src, e.dst, e.relation, e.confidence);
      db.prepare("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO meta (key, value) VALUES ('graph_digest', ?)").run(digest);
    })();
    setLayer(db, "graph", stamp, "ok", `graphify ${provider.version}, ${g.nodes.length} nodes, ${g.edges.length} edges`, now);
  } catch (e) {
    setLayer(db, "graph", stampOf(db, "graph") ?? "none", "unavailable", (e as Error).message, now);
  } finally {
    fs.rmSync(snap, { recursive: true, force: true });
  }
}
```

- In `buildIndex`, immediately after the `const inv = await inventory(...)` statement add the inputs digest (the graph reruns only when the source files, as hashed by the inventory, changed):

```ts
    const digest = createHash("sha256").update(inv.files.map((f) => `${f.path}:${f.hash}`).join("\n")).digest("hex");
```

and replace `setLayer(db, "graph", "none", "disabled", "no graph provider configured", now);` (in the non-quick `else` branch) with `await graphLayer(db, providers.graph, deps, cfg.path, deny, digest, ix, now);`. The two "Tasks 6 and 7 replace these lines" comments in that branch can now be deleted.

In `sindri/src/index/commands.ts`, add `import { makeGraphifyProvider, type GraphProvider } from "./graph.js";` and `import { GRAPHIFY_PIN } from "./pins.js";`, then:

```ts
export function graphFor(loaded: LoadedProfile, deps: Deps, io: IndexIo): GraphProvider | null {
  if (loaded.profile.index.graph === "none") return null;
  return makeGraphifyProvider({ bin: "graphify", version: GRAPHIFY_PIN, runner: { run: io.probes.run }, platform: deps.system.platform, has: io.probes.has, home: deps.home });
}
```

and in `build`, change `graph: null }` in the `buildIndex(...)` call to `graph: graphFor(loaded, deps, io) }`.

Add to `ERRORS`:

```ts
  "SND-INDEX-007": { summary: "No network sandbox is available for graphify.", fix: "macOS: sandbox-exec ships with the OS; Linux: install bubblewrap (bwrap), or set index.graph: none" },
  "SND-INDEX-008": { summary: "graphify is missing, failed or wrote no usable graph.", fix: "sindri index setup, then sindri index build --full" },
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npm run gen && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS (the sandbox smoke tests prove network, write and `~/.ssh` denial where a sandbox and network exist, and skip quietly where they don't); 100% coverage.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/package.json sindri/src sindri/tests docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri graph layer via sandboxed graphify"
```

### Task 8: Staged overlay, shape signals and `sindri index query`

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/overlay.ts`, `sindri/src/index/signals.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/index/commands.ts` (add `query`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/overlay.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/signals.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/index-build.test.ts` (query cases)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IndexDb`, `allSymbols`, `symbolsByAstHash`, `bandCandidates`, `depRows`, `embeddingRows`, `layers` (Task 5); `typescriptParser` (Task 3); `signature`, `bandKeys`, `estimateJaccard` (Task 4); `readManifestDeps` (Task 5); `Embedder`, `embeddingText`, `decodeVec`, `cosine` (Task 6); `matchesAny` (Task 2).
- Produces (`overlay.ts`):
  - `interface StagedChange { path: string; text: string | null }` (`null` = deleted, over the size cap, or unreadable: no symbols).
  - `interface SkippedFile { path: string; reason: "denied" | "too-large" | "unreadable" }`.
  - `stagedChanges(git, worktree: string, o: { denyPaths: readonly string[]; maxFileKB: number }): Promise<{ changes: StagedChange[]; addedLines: number; skipped: SkippedFile[] }>` — from `git diff --cached` in the commit's own worktree (`-M`; binary files count no lines). Denied paths are skipped entirely; a blob over `maxFileKB` (checked with `git cat-file -s` before it is read) becomes `text: null`; a rename reports the **old** path as a deletion too, so a moved file's symbols don't match themselves.
  - `interface OverlaySymbol extends ParsedSymbol { minhash: Uint32Array }`; `interface Overlay { symbols: OverlaySymbol[]; changedPaths: Set<string>; manifests: { path: string; text: string }[]; addedLines: number }`.
  - `buildOverlay(changes: StagedChange[], addedLines: number): Overlay` — parses only TS/JS files and `package.json` manifests.
- Produces (`signals.ts`):
  - `SIGNAL_TYPES` (`as const`) and `type SignalType` = `"reinvented:exact" | "reinvented:name" | "reinvented:embedding" | "reinvented:graph" | "reinvented:dependency" | "generalize:near-clone" | "simpler:diff-size" | "simpler:complexity" | "simpler:exports"`.
  - `interface Signal { type: SignalType; layer: Layer; value: number; threshold: number; at: string; existing: string | null; detail: string; name: string | null; astHash: string | null }` — `at` and `existing` are `path:line`; names in `detail` are wrapped in `<untrusted>…</untrusted>` with `&`, `<` and `>` escaped (spec §6.2 evidence, M4); `name` and `astHash` are the flagged new symbol's (or, for a dependency signal, the added dependency's name and no hash) and are `null` for diff-size and exports. Task 10 uses them to label outcomes.
  - `interface Thresholds` = the profile's `shape.thresholds`.
  - `computeSignals(i: { base: IndexDb; overlay: Overlay; t: Thresholds; sizeBudget: number; exportAllowance: number; embed: { embedder: Embedder; deadline: number; now: () => number } | null }): Promise<{ signals: Signal[]; deferred: Layer[] }>` — the embedding request gets the remaining budget as its abort timeout, and the race timer is cleared.
  - `nameSimilarity(a: string, b: string): number` (1 − normalized Levenshtein on lower-cased word parts).
  - A symbol is a reinvention candidate only if it is not a class and has at least 20 tokens; base candidates are other files' symbols that are exported or under `index.utilityGlobs` (the things meant for reuse). Base symbols are loaded once into memory (no per-row queries).
- Produces (`commands.ts`): `sindri index query <name> [--repo NAME] [--json]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `sindri/src/index/commands.ts`, add `allSymbols`, `bandCandidates`, `symbolsByAstHash` to the `./db.js` import, `import { bandKeys, estimateJaccard } from "./minhash.js";`, then:

```ts

  similarity: number;
}

// For humans at a terminal: names and paths are repo text, so this output is never fed to a session.
function query(args: string[], deps: Deps): CommandResult {
  const { values, positionals } = parseFlags(args, { repo: { type: "string" }, json: { type: "boolean" } });
  const name = positionals[0];
  if (name === undefined) throw new SindriError("SND-CLI-002", "index query needs a symbol name", { fix: "sindri index query <name> [--repo NAME]" });
  const loaded = approvedOrThrow(deps);
  const minJaccard = loaded.profile.shape.thresholds.nearCloneJaccard;
  const rows: QueryRow[] = [];
  const lines: string[] = [];
  for (const repo of reposOf(loaded, values.repo)) {
    const db = openIndexReadOnly(indexPath(deps, repo));
    if (db === null) throw new SindriError("SND-INDEX-404", `no index for ${repo}`, { fix: `sindri index build --repo ${repo}` });
    const all = allSymbols(db);

  }
  return success(lines.join("\n"), rows, values.json === true);
}
```

and in `makeIndexCommand`, before the unknown-subcommand `failure`, add `if (sub === "query") return query(rest, deps);`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS; 100% coverage. If a fixture misses a threshold by a hair (for example, the near-clone Jaccard), fix the fixture body so the case is unambiguous; never lower the default threshold to make a test pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/index sindri/tests
git commit -m "feat: sindri staged overlay, shape signals and index query"
```

### Task 9: `sindri shape --record` at commit, the spool, ingestion and `shape report`

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/spool.ts`, `sindri/src/index/shape.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/scrub/commands.ts` (pre-commit hook v2), `sindri/src/doctor/doctor.ts` (whole-line marker check), `sindri/src/observe/observe.ts` (ingest the spool while recording), `sindri/src/main.ts` (register `shape`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/spool.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/shape.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/scrub-commands.test.ts` (hook v2)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `stagedChanges`, `buildOverlay` (Task 8); `computeSignals`, `Signal`, `SIGNAL_TYPES` (Task 8); `openIndexReadOnly`, `indexPath`, `meta`, `layers`, `LAYERS` (Task 5); `embedderFor` (Task 6); `IndexIo` (Task 1); `openLedgerReadOnly` (Task 1); `approvedProfile`, `acquireTickLock`, `withEpoch`, `ulid` (Plan 2).
- Produces (`spool.ts`):
  - `spoolDir(deps): string` → `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/spool`.
  - `interface ShapeRun { runId: string; repo: string; ts: string; head: string | null; tree: string | null; elapsedMs: number; indexAgeMs: number | null; providers: { embedder: string | null; graph: string | null }; deferred: string[]; signals: Signal[] }` — `head` is the parent commit, `tree` is `git write-tree` of the staged index (what Task 10 matches to the commit that was actually made), `providers` are the layer stamps the base index used.
  - `writeShapeRun(deps, run: ShapeRun): string` — one JSON file `shape-<runId>.json` written to a temp name and renamed (the hook side never touches the ledger, spec §5.2).
  - `ingestSpool(db: Ledger, deps, epoch: number): { runs: number; signals: number; quarantined: number }` — call inside the tick lock; each file is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW`, size-capped, schema-validated (Zod, `type` and `layer` are enums, ids are hex), control characters stripped, scrubbed and inserted once per `runId` (a replayed file is deleted without re-inserting its signals); bad files move to `spool/quarantine/`.
- Produces (`shape.ts`):
  - `makeShapeCommand(io: Pick<IndexIo, "fetch">): Command` — `sindri shape --record --staged [--repo NAME] [--size XS|S|M|L|XL]` (always exit 0) and `sindri shape report [--recent N] [--json]`.
  - `recordStaged(deps, io, o: { repo?: string; size?: Size }): Promise<{ written: string | null; note: string }>` — opens the ledger read-only, finds the profile repo by git common dir (so a linked worktree matches), and diffs the commit's own worktree.
- Produces (`scrub/commands.ts`): hook v2 — marker `# sindri-pre-commit v2`; scrubs (and refuses on a hit), then runs `"$SINDRI" shape --record --staged || true`. `install` upgrades a v1 hook in place; `isSindriHook(text)` matches whole marker lines; `hookBinary` reads both versions.

```

In `sindri/src/observe/observe.ts`, add `import { ingestSpool } from "../index/spool.js";` and, inside `record()`'s `withEpoch` callback, right after the line `setCursor(db, source, snap.cursor, deps.now());` add:

```ts
    ingestSpool(db, deps, epoch);
```

That way the hourly `observe` moves commit-time signals into the ledger.

In `sindri/src/scrub/commands.ts`:
- Replace `export const PRE_COMMIT_MARKER = "# sindri-scrub-pre-commit v1";` with:

```ts
export const PRE_COMMIT_MARKER = "# sindri-pre-commit v2";
const LEGACY_MARKERS: readonly string[] = ["# sindri-scrub-pre-commit v1"];

// A whole-line match, never a substring: a foreign hook that merely mentions a marker isn't ours.
export function isSindriHook(text: string): boolean {
  return text.split("\n").some((l) => l === PRE_COMMIT_MARKER || LEGACY_MARKERS.includes(l));
}
```

- Replace the whole `preCommitHook` function with:

```ts
export function preCommitHook(bin: string): string {
  return `#!/bin/sh
${PRE_COMMIT_MARKER}
# Refuses commits that add secret-shaped strings (spec §8.4), then records shape signals (spec §6.2).
# Installed by \`sindri scrub --install-pre-commit\`.
SINDRI='${bin.replace(/'/g, "'\\''")}'
if [ ! -x "$SINDRI" ] && ! command -v "$SINDRI" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "sindri-scrub: $SINDRI not found, so the secret scan can't run; refusing the commit." >&2
  echo "  fix: scripts/install-sindri.sh (or commit with --no-verify and say why)" >&2
  exit 1
fi
"$SINDRI" scrub --staged || exit 1
# Record-only shape signals (spec §6.2): never blocks the commit.
"$SINDRI" shape --record --staged || true
`;
}
```

- In `install`, replace `!fs.readFileSync(hook, "utf8").includes(PRE_COMMIT_MARKER)` with `!isSindriHook(fs.readFileSync(hook, "utf8"))`. Reinstalling over a v1 hook upgrades it in place.
- `hookBinary` is unchanged (it reads the `SINDRI='…'` line, which both versions have).

In `sindri/src/doctor/doctor.ts`, change the import to `import { hookBinary, isSindriHook, preCommitPath } from "../scrub/commands.js";` and replace `text.includes(PRE_COMMIT_MARKER) ? hookBinary(text) : null` with `isSindriHook(text) ? hookBinary(text) : null`.

Register in `sindri/src/main.ts`:

```ts
import { makeShapeCommand } from "./index/shape.js";

  shape: {
    summary: "Record shape signals for staged changes (pre-commit), or report them",
    usage: [
      "Usage:",
      "  sindri shape --record --staged [--repo NAME] [--size XS|S|M|L|XL]   (always exits 0)",
      "  sindri shape report [--recent N] [--json]",
    ].join("\n"),
    run: makeShapeCommand(realIndexIo()),
  },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS; 100% coverage.

### Task 10: Outcome labels and precision (`shape reconcile`)

Row 7's point is calibration, and calibration needs to know what happened to the code a signal pointed at. This task links each recorded run to the commit that was actually made, labels each signal once it is old enough, and makes `sindri shape report` show per-type precision against the rollout step 3b bar. There are no hand labels (spec invariant 9): the label is an **outcome proxy**. A signal counts as right when the flagged code was later changed or removed; code is also changed for unrelated reasons, and a right signal can be ignored. Say so wherever the numbers are shown.

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/reconcile.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/index/shape.ts` (replace `report`), `sindri/src/observe/observe.ts` (reconcile after recording)
- Test: `sindri/tests/shape-reconcile.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/shape.test.ts` (replace one report test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: ledger v2 outcome columns (Task 1); `ShapeRun.tree`, `Signal.name/astHash` (Tasks 8 and 9); `readManifestDeps` (Task 5); `typescriptParser` (Task 3); `withEpoch` (Plan 2); `GitRunner` through `deps.git`.
- Produces (`reconcile.ts`): `reconcileShape(db: Ledger, deps: Deps, loaded: LoadedProfile, epoch: number): Promise<{ linked: number; labeled: number }>` — call inside the tick lock with the epoch it was acquired under; the git work happens first and the ledger writes go through `withEpoch`.
  1. **Link.** For runs with `commit_sha` null and a `tree`, run `git log --all --format='%H %T' --since=<the oldest such run's ts minus 1 day>` in the repo and map each run's tree to the commit that has it (the oldest such commit if several). A run older than 7 days with no match gets outcome `dropped` on all its signals (the commit was never made, or was amended). A repo that isn't in the approved profile, or where git fails, is skipped.
  2. **Label.** For each signal with outcome null whose run has a `commit_sha` and is at least `shape.outcomeDays` (default 14) old:
     - Everything is read from the **default branch's content**, never from the working tree or the index (round-2 N1). The tip is `origin/<defaultBranch>` after a best-effort `git fetch`, falling back to the local branch. If neither resolves, the signals stay unlabeled.
     - `simpler:diff-size`, `simpler:exports`, or a signal with no `name`: `n/a`.
     - If the flagged `name` never appeared in that file on the default branch since the run (`git log <tip> --since=<run−1d> -S<name> -- <file>` is empty): `dropped`. Content-based, so squash and rebase merges count as merged (round-2 N2).
     - `reinvented:dependency`: `kept` if the manifest at the tip still lists the dependency, else `acted-on`.
     - Other symbol signals: parse the file at the tip; `kept` if a symbol with that name has the recorded `ast_hash`, else `acted-on`.
- Produces (`shape.ts`): `shape report` reconciles after ingesting, and prints `TYPE | SIGNALS | LABELED | ACTED-ON | KEPT | PRECISION | TOWARD 3b`. LABELED is acted-on plus kept; PRECISION is acted-on / LABELED; TOWARD 3b reads `12/30 labeled; bar 0.70`, or `ready` once labeled >= 30 and precision >= 0.7. It also prints how many runs deferred the embeddings layer. `--json` adds `types` and `layers` (the same numbers per type and per layer).
- Produces (`observe.ts`): `observe` reconciles right after it records, inside the same tick lock.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

The labeling reads the default branch's content (round-2 fix), so the fixture builds a real history: the default branch (named by `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`, which the test pins equal to the profile's `defaultBranch`) holds the merged changes; an unmerged change sits on a side branch (`feature`); a squash merge lands on the default branch as a new commit with the same content as a branch that is never merged (`squash-src`). The fixture leaves `feature` checked out, so every labeling test already runs with a different branch checked out; two more cases prove the labels do not move when the default branch is checked out with a dirty working tree, or when the local default branch is stale behind `origin/<default>`. No index is built: the labels must not need one.

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: all tests PASS; 100% coverage.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests
git commit -m "feat: sindri shape outcome labels and per-type precision"
```

### Task 11: `sindri repo add`, `sindri index setup` and the `doctor` index checks

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/index/setup.ts`, `sindri/src/index/repo-add.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/index/commands.ts` (add `setup`), `sindri/src/main.ts` (register `repo`), `sindri/src/doctor/doctor.ts`, `sindri/src/errors.ts`, `sindri/tests/doctor.test.ts` (Plan 2's tests, exact edits below)
- Test: `sindri/tests/index-setup.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/repo-add.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/doctor.test.ts` (index checks)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `hasBinary`, `IndexProbes`, `IndexIo` (Tasks 1 and 5); `sandboxArgv` (Task 7); `GRAPHIFY_PIN`, `GRAPHIFY_PIN_DATE` (Task 7); `openIndexReadOnly`, `indexPath`, `meta`, `layers` (Task 5); `heavyLockState`, `heavyLockDir` (Task 1); `requireProfile`, `sanitizeName` (Plan 2 Task 6); `runChecks`, `Check` (Plan 2 Task 10); `approvedOrThrow` (Task 5).
- Produces (`setup.ts`): `runSetup(loaded, probes: IndexProbes, o: { dryRun: boolean; platform: NodeJS.Platform; home: string; log: (line: string) => void }): Promise<{ steps: Step[] }>` with `Step = { name; status: "ok" | "done" | "would" | "skip" | "warn" | "fail"; detail; fix? }`. It **never returns early**: every step is evaluated and reported. Steps in order: `ollama`, `ollama-server`, `embedding-model`, `graphify`, `sandbox`; steps for a layer the profile turns off are omitted. With Ollama missing, `ollama-server` and `embedding-model` are `skip` ("needs ollama"). graphify is installed with `uv tool install graphifyy==<pin> --exclude-newer <the pin's upload time>` (uv is required; there is no pipx path), and every `graphify --version` runs inside the sandbox. The `sandbox` step uses a positive control: it runs `curl -sS --max-time 3 https://example.com` unsandboxed first; if curl is missing or that fails the step is `warn` ("can't verify: offline or curl missing; rerun online"); only when the unsandboxed request succeeds and the sandboxed one fails is the step `ok`; if both succeed it is `fail`. Also exports `hasModel(tags, model)` and `graphifyVersion(stdout)` (the first `x.y.z`, compared for equality with the pin).
- Produces (`repo-add.ts`): `repoAdd(deps, target: string, name?: string): Promise<{ name: string; path: string; added: boolean }>` and `repoCommand: Command` — adds `repos/<name>.yaml` and the `repos` entry to the **live** profile (comments preserved, `profile.yaml` replaced atomically); `--name` goes through `sanitizeName` and is refused if that would change it. It does not create the mirror: `index build` does (spec amendment 9). The change takes effect after `profile approve`.
- Produces (`commands.ts`): `sindri index setup [--dry-run] [--json]` — reads the **approved** profile (so an unapproved edit can't choose the model or the repos), exit 2 on any `fail`, 1 on any `warn`.
- Produces (`doctor.ts`): `runChecks(deps, nodeVersion?, probes?: IndexProbes)` adds, after the Plan 2 checks: `index:<repo>` per repo, `embeddings`, `embedding-proxy` (only when `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`), `graphify`, `heavy-lock`.

Edit Plan 2's `sindri/tests/doctor.test.ts` (exact changes):

1. Add the imports `import { makeIndexCommand } from "../src/index/commands.js";`, `import type { IndexProbes } from "../src/index/io.js";` and `import { fakeIndexIo } from "./index-fixtures.js";`.
2. Replace the line `const byName = async (deps: Deps, node = "22.10.0") => Object.fromEntries((await runChecks(deps, node)).map((c) => [c.name, c]));` with:

```ts
// Plan 2's tests never touch the machine's Ollama or graphify: nothing is installed, nothing answers.
const offline: IndexProbes = { has: () => false, run: async () => ({ code: 127, stdout: "", stderr: "" }), getJson: async () => null };
const byName = async (deps: Deps, node = "22.10.0") => Object.fromEntries((await runChecks(deps, node, offline)).map((c) => [c.name, c]));
```

3. In `ring0Deps()`, after the line `await runCli(["profile", "init", "--ring0"], d);` add:

```ts
  fs.appendFileSync(path.join(d.env.AW_STATE_DIR as string, "profile", "profile.yaml"), "index:\n  embeddings:\n    enabled: false\n  graph: none\n");
```

4. In the test `is all ok after ring-0 init, approve and pre-commit install (spec §13.3 evidence)`, after the line `await runCli(["scrub", "--install-pre-commit"], d);` add:

```ts
    await makeIndexCommand(fakeIndexIo())(["build"], d);
```

Then add to the same file (the new imports it needs: `import { approvedIndexDeps, ring0Name, ring0Repo } from "./index-fixtures.js";` merged with the one above, `import { indexPath, openIndex } from "../src/index/db.js";`, `import { heavyLockDir } from "../src/index/heavy-lock.js";`, `import { GRAPHIFY_PIN } from "../src/index/pins.js";`, `import { awStateDir } from "../src/deps.js";`):

In `sindri/src/doctor/doctor.ts`, add the imports `import { awStateDir, stateDir, type Deps } from "../deps.js";` (extend the existing import), `import { indexPath, layers, meta, openIndexReadOnly } from "../index/db.js";`, `import { sandboxArgv } from "../index/graph.js";`, `import { heavyLockDir, heavyLockState } from "../index/heavy-lock.js";`, `import type { IndexProbes } from "../index/io.js";`, `import { GRAPHIFY_PIN } from "../index/pins.js";`, `import { realIndexProbes } from "../index/sandbox-real.js";`, `import { graphifyVersion, hasModel } from "../index/setup.js";`, give `runChecks` a third parameter, and append the index checks to the valid-profile branch:

```ts
export async function runChecks(deps: Deps, nodeVersion: string = process.versions.node, probes: IndexProbes = realIndexProbes()): Promise<Check[]> {
```

and replace the last line of `runChecks` with:

```ts
  return [...checks, { name: "profile", status: "ok", detail: root }, ...(await profileChecks(deps, r.value)), ...(await indexChecks(deps, r.value, probes))];
```

with this function added above `runChecks`:

```ts
async function indexChecks(deps: Deps, loaded: LoadedProfile, probes: IndexProbes): Promise<Check[]> {
  const out: Check[] = [];
  const ix = loaded.profile.index;

### Task 12: Docs, merge gate and spec amendments

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/sindri/index.md`
- Modify: `docs/sindri/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/testing.md`, `planning/ERD.md`, `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything in Tasks 1–11.
- Produces: the index documentation and the amended spec. No code.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `docs/sindri/index.md`**

````markdown
# Sindri code index

One index per repo at `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/index/<repo>.db`, built from tracked files only (`git ls-files`, minus `index.denyPaths`, matched case-insensitively; symlinks never followed). Spec: §6.2.

## First run

```bash
sindri profile init --ring0 && sindri profile approve   # or: profile init, repo add <path>, profile approve
sindri index setup      # checks Ollama, pulls the embedding model, installs the pinned graphify with uv, probes the sandbox
sindri index build      # full build; also creates the bare mirror at $AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/mirrors/<repo>.git
sindri scrub --install-pre-commit   # hook v2: secret scan, then shape recording
```

`index setup` reads the **approved** profile, so approve first. It needs Ollama (running, with the model), `uv`, and macOS `sandbox-exec` (or Linux `bwrap`). Without one of them that layer is `unavailable` and everything else works.

## Layers

| Layer | What it holds | Built with | Off switch |
|---|---|---|---|
| structure | functions, methods, arrows, classes: name, signature, lines, exported, complexity, callees | TypeScript compiler API (TS and JS) | none |
| clones | normalized AST hash per symbol; MinHash/LSH bands over 5-token shingles | core | none |
| deps | `package.json` dependencies with purpose tags (date, http, id, validation, …) | core | none |
| embeddings | one vector per symbol | Ollama on loopback (`index.embeddings`) | `index.embeddings.enabled: false` |
| graph | module and call graph | graphify in a sandbox, on a snapshot of the tracked source and docs files | `index.graph: none` |

**Offline guarantee.** Code never leaves the machine.

- The embedding URL must be the IP literal `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` with no credentials (not `localhost`), requests refuse redirects, and a model whose name contains `cloud` is refused, because Ollama cloud models forward the text to a remote service. Node's `fetch` ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY` unless `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` is set; `doctor` warns if it is. A loopback port that is really an SSH or port-forward tunnel is not this machine; that is documented, not detected.
- graphify runs under `sandbox-exec` (macOS) or `bwrap --unshare-net` (Linux): no network, writes only to its snapshot dir, and `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.agentic-workflow` and `~/Library/Keychains` hidden, with a cleaned environment. Everything else stays readable, so a compromised graphify could still read other files in your home directory; `graph.json` is size-capped and treated as untrusted. It doesn't run at all without a sandbox. `sindri index setup` proves the sandbox denies the network with a positive control: the same request must succeed outside it.
- graphify is installed at an exact pin (`sindri.graphifyPin` in `sindri/package.json`, at least 14 days old) with `uv tool install --exclude-newer <the pin's upload date>`, which also age-gates its dependencies.
- Symbol bodies are scrubbed before they are stored. The state dir holds source text (the index and the mirror): keep it out of cloud sync and backups you don't control. The mirror holds the repo's full, unfiltered history, including deleted secrets and denied paths, so it is never mounted into a guest without a deny filter.

## Commands

```bash
sindri index setup [--dry-run]          # steps: ollama, ollama-server, embedding-model, graphify, sandbox (all reported, none skipped by an earlier failure)
sindri index build [--quick] [--full]   # incremental; --quick: structure, clones and deps only; --full rebuilds; takes the box-wide heavy-job lock
sindri index status                     # every repo: age, commit, per-layer status with the reason; exit 1 when an index is missing or stale
sindri index query <name>               # a symbol's exact and near clones (for people: output is repo text, never feed it to a session)
sindri repo add <path> [--name NAME]    # profile entry (then sindri profile approve); the next full index build mirrors it
sindri shape report [--recent N]        # signals by type, outcomes and precision; --recent lists signals with their evidence
```

A failed layer is `unavailable` with its reason; the other layers stay usable. Builds write a temp copy and rename it, so an interrupted build leaves the previous index in place.

## Freshness

An hourly `sindri index build --quick` (launchd) refreshes structure, clones and deps; the nightly build at 03:15 refreshes everything. Both read the files **as checked out** (the working tree), so keep `main` checked out in the indexed checkout; uncommitted work there becomes base data. Each shape run records the index age. The bare mirror is for a later plan (guest sandboxes).

## Shape signals (record-only)

The pre-commit hook (installed by `sindri scrub --install-pre-commit`) scans for secrets, then runs `sindri shape --record --staged`. That compares the staged changes of the commit's own worktree (an in-memory overlay; denied paths and files over `index.maxFileKB` are skipped) with the index and writes the signals to `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/spool/`. It opens the ledger read-only and always exits 0: nothing blocks a commit until rollout step 3b. The hourly `observe` and `sindri shape report` move the spool into the ledger.

| Signal | Fires when | Default threshold (`shape.thresholds`) |
|---|---|---|
| `reinvented:exact` | a new symbol has the same normalized AST as another file's symbol | none |
| `generalize:near-clone` | MinHash similarity with another symbol, both at least N tokens | Jaccard 0.8, 60 tokens |
| `reinvented:name` | name and signature similar to an exported or utility symbol | 0.85 |
| `reinvented:graph` | call set overlaps an exported or utility symbol's (≥ 3 calls each) | 0.5 |
| `reinvented:embedding` | embedding cosine and AST similarity both high (only within the commit budget) | 0.9 and 0.6 |
| `reinvented:dependency` | a new dependency shares a purpose tag with an existing one | none |
| `simpler:diff-size` | added lines over the size budget (`shape.defaultSize`, default S = 250) | `shape.sizeBudget` |
| `simpler:complexity` | a symbol's complexity grew by more than the limit | 10 |
| `simpler:exports` | more new exports than the size class allows | `shape.exportAllowance` |

Names in signal details are wrapped in `<untrusted>…</untrusted>` with `&`, `<` and `>` escaped: they come from the repo, not from Sindri. To turn recording off, set `shape.record: false` (and approve the profile); to remove the hook step, reinstall without it or delete the `shape --record` line.

## Outcomes and precision (the 3b bar)

Each recorded run keeps `git write-tree` of the staged index. `observe` and `shape report` link a run to the commit with that tree. Once the commit is `shape.outcomeDays` (14) old, each signal gets an outcome:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kept` | the flagged symbol (same file, same name, same AST) or dependency is still there |
| `acted-on` | it was changed or removed |
| `dropped` | the commit was never made, was amended, or never reached the default branch |
| `n/a` | diff size and export count have no flagged symbol |

`sindri shape report` prints, per type, `SIGNALS | LABELED | ACTED-ON | KEPT | PRECISION | TOWARD 3b`. Precision is `acted-on / (acted-on + kept)`, and 3b wants at least 30 labeled signals and precision at least 0.70 per layer (`ready`). This is an **outcome proxy, not a human label**: code is changed for other reasons too, and a correct signal can be ignored. It exists so thresholds can be tuned without anyone hand-labeling (spec invariant 9).

## Troubleshooting

| `index status` or `doctor` says | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `no index` | never built | `sindri index build --repo <repo>` |
| `stale` | older than `index.maxAgeHours` | `sindri index build`; if the launchd job should have run, read `~/.agentic-workflow/sindri/index-launchd.log` |
| `never built` | an empty index file | `sindri index build --repo <repo>` |
| `embeddings unavailable (Ollama not answering …)` | Ollama is down or the model is missing | start Ollama, `sindri index setup` |
| `graph unavailable (…)` | graphify missing, wrong version or failed | `sindri index setup`, then `sindri index build --full` |
| `embeddings pending` / `graph pending` | only quick builds have run | `sindri index build` |
| `SND-INDEX-001` / `heavy-lock held` | another heavy job (a test run, another build) holds the lock | wait; a lock whose holder pid is dead on this host is reclaimed automatically; otherwise `rmdir $AW_STATE_DIR/locks/heavy` |
| `sindri-shape: skipped (no index; …)` in a commit | the hook found no index for this repo | `sindri index build` |
````

- [ ] **Step 2: Update the other docs and the spec**

- `docs/sindri/README.md`: add rows for `sindri index setup|build|status|query`, `sindri repo add`, and `sindri shape --record --staged | report`, and a line under "Where things live" for `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/index/<repo>.db`, `…/spool/` and `…/mirrors/<repo>.git`. Link `docs/sindri/index.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` Commands: add `sindri index setup && sindri index build    # code index (Ollama + graphify, offline)` and `sindri shape report                      # record-only shape signals and their outcomes`.
- `.agents/rules/testing.md`: add `src/index/sandbox-real.ts` to the `sindri` coverage excludes, update the `sindri` test count from `npx vitest run`, then run `scripts/sync-rules.sh`.
- `planning/ERD.md`: add `shape_runs` and `shape_signals` (ledger v2, with `tree`, `commit_sha`, `name`, `ast_hash`, `outcome`, `labeled_at`) to the Sindri ledger diagram, one attribute per line, and a `## Sindri code index` section with the index tables from `src/index/db.ts` (`meta`, `layers`, `files`, `symbols`, `bands`, `deps`, `embeddings`, `graph_nodes`, `graph_edges`), noting the index is rebuilt, not migrated.
- `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` `## Sindri`: add one paragraph on the index: five layers, offline guarantee, temp-copy builds under the heavy-job lock, hourly quick and nightly full builds, record-only shape signals through the spool, outcome labels by tree reconcile.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md`:
  - §6.2 index table, Structure row "Built with": "TypeScript compiler API for TS/JS (v1); tree-sitter grammars for other languages in a later plan; LSP (Serena) when available".
  - §6.2 Embeddings row: "Ollama on loopback (`index.embeddings.url` must be the IP literal `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`; redirects and cloud models are refused)".
  - §6.2 Offline guarantee: add "graphify runs on a snapshot of the tracked, non-denied source and docs files, never on the working tree; network denied, writes confined to the snapshot, credential directories hidden, environment cleaned. Everything else stays readable (residual risk). graphify is installed at an exact, 14-day-old pin with `uv --exclude-newer`."
  - §6.2 Freshness: add "An hourly quick build (structure, clones, deps) and a nightly full build; both read the files as checked out, so keep the default branch checked out in the indexed checkout."
  - §6.2 Signals intro: add "Until rollout step 3b, signals are recorded only: the pre-commit hook opens the ledger read-only, writes them to the spool and never blocks. Each run records the staged tree hash; once its commit is 14 days old each signal is labeled kept, acted-on, dropped or n/a, and per-layer precision (acted-on over acted-on plus kept) is the 3b bar. This is an outcome proxy, not a human label."
  - §8.2 Heavy-job lock: add "Host side: a `mkdir` lock at `$AW_STATE_DIR/locks/heavy`, the same primitive as `config/lib/locks.sh`; a holder whose pid is dead on this host is reclaimed."
  - §10.3 CLI table: `sindri index status` lists every repo (a missing index is a row and exit 1, not an `SND-INDEX-404` abort; `index query` still uses `SND-INDEX-404`); `sindri repo add` edits the profile only, and each full `index build` creates or refreshes the mirror.
  - §13.3 row "Code index, record-only shape signals (P3)": the switch-on is `sindri index setup && sindri index build`, `sindri repo add .`, `sindri scrub --install-pre-commit` (upgrades the hook to v2, which records shape signals), an hourly `sindri index build --quick` and a nightly full build (launchd). A degraded switch-on (embeddings or graph unavailable) is allowed; the PR evidence lists the layers that are down.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the merge gate, one job at a time**

```bash
cd sindri && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage && cd ..
bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh
scripts/sync-rules.sh --check
./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run > /dev/null && echo SETUP_DRY_RUN_OK
```

Expected: no type errors; 100% coverage; installer tests PASS; `sync-rules` exits 0; `SETUP_DRY_RUN_OK`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/sindri AGENTS.md .agents/rules/testing.md planning docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md
git commit -m "docs: sindri code index docs, ERD and spec amendments"
```

### Task 13: Turn it on (bootstrapping ladder, spec §13.3 row 7)

From the merge on, every commit in this repo records shape signals against an index that is refreshed hourly (cheap layers) and nightly (everything), and each signal's outcome is labeled after 14 days, so the thresholds that rollout step 3b will enforce are calibrated on Sindri's own Plan 4 and Plan 5 commits. Steps 1–4 run on the PR branch; steps 5–6 run after merge. The switch-on may be **degraded**: if Ollama, uv or the sandbox is missing, embeddings or the graph stay `unavailable`, the rest still switches on, and the evidence says which layers are down (they go under "Known gaps" in the PR).

**Files:**
- Create: `config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index.plist`, `config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index-quick.plist`
- Modify: `config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-observe.plist` (Plan 2's; add `PATH`), `scripts/install-sindri.sh` (install the three jobs), `scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the preconditions (builder, before writing anything)**

```bash
for bin in git node curl; do command -v "$bin" >/dev/null || echo "MISSING (required): $bin"; done
for bin in ollama uv; do command -v "$bin" >/dev/null || echo "MISSING (the embeddings or graph layer degrades without it): $bin"; done
[ "$(uname -s)" != Darwin ] || command -v sandbox-exec >/dev/null || echo "MISSING (the graph layer degrades without it): sandbox-exec"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w 'ollama: HTTP %{http_code}\n' --max-time 3 http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags || echo "ollama: not answering (start the app)"
```

Expected: no `MISSING (required)` line; an `ollama: HTTP 200` line if the embeddings layer is going to be `ok`. Anything else is a known gap to record, not a blocker.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test**

Append to `scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh` (and add it to the list of calls):

```bash
test_index_jobs() {
  local launchd="$ROOT/config/launchd"
  local name plist
  for name in sindri-observe sindri-index sindri-index-quick; do
    plist="$launchd/com.agentic-workflow.$name.plist"
    [ -f "$plist" ] || { echo "FAIL: $plist missing"; exit 1; }
    if command -v plutil >/dev/null 2>&1; then plutil -lint "$plist" >/dev/null || { echo "FAIL: $name plist invalid"; exit 1; }; fi
    grep -q '<string>__BIN__/sindri</string>' "$plist" || { echo "FAIL: $name command missing"; exit 1; }
    grep -q '<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>' "$plist" && grep -q '<string>__BIN__:__HOME__/.local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>' "$plist" || { echo "FAIL: $name has no PATH (launchd's default has no uv or Homebrew)"; exit 1; }
    grep -q "com.agentic-workflow.$name" "$ROOT/scripts/install-sindri.sh" || { echo "FAIL: installer does not install $name"; exit 1; }
    sed -e "s|__HOME__|/h|g" -e "s|__BIN__|/b|g" "$plist" | grep -q '__' && { echo "FAIL: $name has a placeholder the installer does not substitute"; exit 1; }
  done
  grep -q '<string>--quick</string>' "$launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index-quick.plist" && grep -q '<integer>3600</integer>' "$launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index-quick.plist" || { echo "FAIL: the quick job is not an hourly --quick build"; exit 1; }
  grep -q '<key>Hour</key>' "$launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index.plist" || { echo "FAIL: the full build is not nightly"; exit 1; }
  if grep -q -- '--quick' "$launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index.plist"; then echo "FAIL: the nightly build is quick"; exit 1; fi
  echo "PASS: test_index_jobs"
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`
Expected: the earlier tests PASS, then `FAIL: …/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-observe.plist has no PATH …` (Plan 2's plist has none yet).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement**

In `scripts/install-sindri.sh`, replace Plan 2's whole launchd block (the `if [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ] && [ "${AW_SKIP_LAUNCHD:-0}" != "1" ]; then … fi` that starts after the comment `# Hourly \`sindri observe\` keeps the ledger's plan-task state current`) with:

```bash
# launchd jobs (macOS only; AW_SKIP_LAUNCHD=1 skips them, which the tests use): the hourly observe
# keeps the ledger's plan-task state current, the hourly quick index build keeps structure, clones and
# deps fresh, and the nightly full build refreshes everything. Each plist sets PATH, because launchd's
# default has neither ~/.local/bin (uv tools) nor Homebrew.
if [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ] && [ "${AW_SKIP_LAUNCHD:-0}" != "1" ]; then
  LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents"
  mkdir -p "$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR" "${AW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.agentic-workflow}/sindri"
  for NAME in com.agentic-workflow.sindri-observe com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index-quick com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index; do
    sed -e "s|__HOME__|$HOME|g" -e "s|__BIN__|$BIN_DIR|g" "$SCRIPT_DIR/config/launchd/$NAME.plist" > "$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR/$NAME.plist"
    launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)" "$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR/$NAME.plist" 2>/dev/null || true
    launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" "$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR/$NAME.plist"
  done
  echo "  sindri: hourly observe and quick index build, nightly full index build at 03:15 (launchd)"
fi
```

and replace the dry-run line `echo "  [dry-run] would install launchd job com.agentic-workflow.sindri-observe.plist (macOS)"` with:

```bash
  for name in sindri-observe sindri-index-quick sindri-index; do
    echo "  [dry-run] would install launchd job com.agentic-workflow.$name.plist (macOS)"
  done
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and commit**

Run: `bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`
Expected: every test PASS, including `test_index_jobs` and Plan 2's `test_observe_job_is_hourly`.

```bash
git add config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-observe.plist config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index.plist config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.sindri-index-quick.plist scripts/install-sindri.sh scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh
git commit -m "feat: hourly quick and nightly full sindri index builds"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: After merge, switch on (builder)**

The profile file is unchanged by this plan (new keys have defaults), so the approved profile stays approved. No human step is needed, unless `sindri repo add .` reports that this repo is not yet in the profile (then run `sindri profile approve` at a terminal).

```bash
scripts/install-sindri.sh              # CLI + hourly observe + hourly quick index + nightly full index
sindri repo add .                      # ring 0 is already in the profile: prints "<name> is already in the profile."
sindri index setup                     # Ollama model, pinned graphify, sandbox probe (heavy: run alone)
sindri index build                     # full build and the bare mirror (heavy: run alone)
sindri index status
sindri scrub --install-pre-commit      # upgrades the hook to v2 (scan, then record shape signals)
sindri doctor; echo "doctor exit: $?"
```

Expected, full switch-on: every `index setup` step `ok` or `done`; `index status` shows `structure ok, clones ok, deps ok, embeddings ok, graph ok`; `doctor exit: 0`. Degraded switch-on: `index setup` shows `fail` or `skip` for what is missing (each with its fix), `index status` shows `embeddings unavailable (…)` or `graph unavailable (…)` with the reason, and `doctor` warns for exactly those layers (exit 1); that is acceptable, and the PR evidence lists them under "Known gaps".

- [ ] **Step 7: Prove it records, then post the evidence**

Make the first ordinary commit of Plan 4 work (or any real commit), then:

```bash
sindri shape report --recent 5
```

Expected: `Ingested N run(s), M signal(s).` with N >= 1 (the first `observe` run may have ingested it already, in which case the run count shows under `Runs:`), a table of signal types (it may be empty if the commit was clean, which is also evidence), and the last signals with their evidence. After the commit is 14 days old, `sindri shape report` also fills the LABELED, PRECISION and TOWARD 3b columns. Post the Step 6 and Step 7 output as a comment on the Plan 3 PR. From then on (row 7):
- every build commit is recorded against the index;
- `shape report` shows per-type labeled counts, precision and progress toward the 3b bar, which rollout step 3b uses to decide enforcement per layer.

## Done criteria for this plan
- Merge gate (AGENTS.md) green for `sindri`, plus `bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`, `scripts/sync-rules.sh --check` and `./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run`.
- Every Review Focus item (1–7) has its pinned test passing.
- `GRAPHIFY_PIN` is a real version at least 14 days old, `GRAPHIFY_PIN_DATE` is its upload time, and the graphify fixture was recorded from it under the sandbox.
- **Switched on (Task 13):** after merge, `index status` shows structure, clones and deps `ok` (and embeddings and graph `ok`, or `unavailable` with a recorded reason in a degraded switch-on), `doctor` has no warning beyond the recorded gaps, and `shape report` has ingested at least one real commit's run. The evidence is posted on the PR. Plan 4 starts from `sindri observe`'s `Next up:`.
