# Sindri Plan 6: The Dashboard (fleet collector, `aw:fleet` hook spool, local dashboard, attach, menu-bar badge) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give the builder one place to see every agent on the machine and what needs them (spec §1). This plan builds:
- **`sindri fleet`**, a read-only collector. It covers Claude Code, Codex and Cursor sessions (including ones Sindri didn't start), Sindri's own jobs, the onboarded repos, gh pull requests and bridge messages. It gives exactly one state per session and one sorted "needs you" list.
- **The `aw:fleet` hook**, installed for every provider. It appends one short line per event to a spool, which is the authoritative "waiting on you" signal.
- **`sindri dashboard`**, a loopback-only HTTP server over `sindri … --json`. It has five views, an attention signal you can notice without reading, and a fixed action list in which terminal-gated commands are only ever shown.
- **Attach**, which brings a live session's host to the front and resumes only sessions that have ended. It never resumes a live one.
- **A SwiftBar menu-bar badge.**

**Architecture:**
- **`sindri/src/fleet/`** (collector):
  - **Adapters** (`adapters/claude.ts`, `codex.ts`, `cursor.ts`, `sindri.ts`): each discovers sessions or jobs from the provider stores. They read only bounded file tails, never write, and each runs inside its own error and time boundary (`collect.ts` `runSource`).
  - **`spool.ts`**: turns hook payloads into one-line events, appends them, rotates by size and summarises them per session.
  - **`state.ts`**: pure rules from signals to one state, plus the subagent roll-up.
  - **`needs.ts`**: the needs-you aggregator, fed by `decisions.ts` (ledger, profile, channels), `gh.ts` (PRs, cached 2 min), `bridge.ts` (unread count, read-only) and `acks.ts`.
  - **`command.ts`**: `sindri fleet [--json] [--provider P] [--state S] [--badge]`, `sindri fleet hook <provider>` and `sindri fleet ack <key>`.
- **`sindri/src/dashboard/`** (server):
  - `tokens.ts` (one-time tokens, sessions, CSRF), `security.ts` (headers, Host and Origin checks), `actions.ts` (read map, safe-action allowlist, terminal-only commands), `server.ts` (`node:http` handler and loopback listener), `attach.ts` (resolver and launcher) and `command.ts` (`sindri dashboard [--url] [--port N] [--open PATH]`).
  - The server holds no state of its own: every view is a cached `sindri … --json` run, and every action is a checked argv run with no shell.
- **`sindri/ui/`** (browser): static HTML and CSS plus TypeScript compiled by `tsc`. `model.ts` holds the pure view logic and is unit-tested with 100% coverage; `app.ts` is the DOM glue, tested in real Chromium. No framework, no CDN, no inline script or style.
- **`config/hooks/fleet.sh`** (the `aw:fleet` hook, run directly for Claude Code and through the Codex and Cursor adapters) and **`config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh`**. `scripts/install-sindri.sh` installs both.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.7 strict, ESM, Node >= 20.11, Vitest 2 (v8, 100%), Zod 3, better-sqlite3 13 (read-only opens), `node:http` (no web framework), browser code compiled by `tsc` (DOM lib, ES2022 modules), Playwright `^1.48.0` (the dependency `skills/ui-evidence` already uses for its real-Chromium tests) for UI behaviour, bash 3.2 + jq for the hook and the installers, and the SwiftBar plugin format.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-sindri-dashboard-design.md` (approved, binding: every section). Background: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md` §10.5, whose security and accessibility rules stay unless the new spec replaces them. Where the two disagree, the new spec wins.

**Depends on:** Plans 2–5 merged. This plan uses these existing pieces:
- **Plan 2:** `Deps`, `SystemProbe.pidStartTime`, `GitRunner`, `success`/`failure`/`fromError`, `SindriError`, `parseFlags`, `makeScrubber`, `openLedgerReadOnly`, `approvedProfile`/`approvalState`, `loadProfile`/`resolveProfileRoot` and `ulid`. `pidStartTime` runs `ps -o lstart=` under `TZ=UTC LC_ALL=C`, which is the exact string Claude Code writes as `procStart` (checked on this machine: `Fri Oct  9 19:23:16 2026` for both).
- **Plan 3:** `ProcessRunner`, `realProcessRunner`, `heavyLockState`/`heavyLockDir`/`withHeavyLock`, `openIndexReadOnly`/`indexPath`/`meta`.
- **Plan 5:** `escapeInvisible` (`evolve/invisible.ts`, the shared sanitizer from #82), `textBlocks`/`toolNames` (`evolve/transcripts.ts`), `readChannels`/`canPromote`, `ghRepoOf`/`ghJson`, `ringZeroRepo`, `STATUSES`.

The source-based privacy work runs in a parallel plan. This plan doesn't touch `privacy.*`, `src/evolve/privacy.ts` or their docs. Every collector string goes through `src/fleet/text.ts` (`cleanLine`/`cleanText`), which is the single point where source-based rules plug in when they land.

## Task list

| # | Task | Commands it adds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fleet types, limits, the text sanitizer, the bounded tail reader, profile keys `dashboard.*` and `fleet.*` | |
| 2 | The process table and the Claude Code adapter | |
| 3 | The Codex and Cursor adapters | |
| 4 | Sindri jobs: job records from `runCli`, the heavy-lock queue, repo status | |
| 5 | The `aw:fleet` hook, the spool, per-provider install | (`fleet.sh`, `install-sindri.sh --fleet-hook`) |
| 6 | State rules (pure, table-driven) and the subagent roll-up | |
| 7 | The needs-you aggregator: decisions, failures, gh PRs (cached), bridge unread, acks | |
| 8 | The `sindri fleet` command and the collector | `sindri fleet`, `fleet hook`, `fleet ack` |
| 9 | Dashboard server security, the read map, the action allowlist | `sindri dashboard [--url] [--port N] [--open PATH]` |
| 10 | The dashboard UI: five views, deep links, polling, states, the attention signal | |
| 11 | Attach: resolver and launcher, never resuming a live session | (`POST /api/attach`) |
| 12 | The SwiftBar badge and its installer step | `sindri fleet --badge` |
| 13 | Docs, the end-to-end evidence run, and the merge gate | |

## Spec decisions in this plan

These resolve the spec's open points; each one is restated in `docs/sindri/dashboard.md` in Task 13.

1. **The Claude result record.** The JSONL transcripts on disk have no `result` record: that's an SDK stream message, and T3 reads it from the SDK. So the Claude adapter derives `terminalReason` from the transcript:
   - `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]` gives `aborted_tools`, and `[Request interrupted by user]` gives `aborted_streaming`;
   - a `system/turn_duration` or `system/stop_hook_summary` line gives `completed`;
   - a synthetic assistant line with `isApiErrorMessage: true` gives `error`.

   If a `{"type":"result", "terminal_reason": …}` line ever appears, it is honoured the same way.
2. **429 versus 529.** These give `limited`: 429, "usage limit" or "rate limit" text, or `error: "rate_limit"`. A 529, an overload or any other API error gives `failed`. `error: "authentication_failed"` (or "Login expired") gives `auth` while the process lives, and `failed` with "login expired" once it's gone.
3. **The status file's `waiting`.** `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` carries `status: busy | idle | waiting`. With no spool event, `waiting` shows as `approval`, with the reason "the session says it is waiting on you". A spooled question turns it into `input`.
4. **When a pending event is resolved.** A spooled permission, question or plan event stays pending until one of these is newer than it:
   - a later spool event (`Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact`, or another pending kind);
   - a transcript output line (an assistant line or a tool result).

   There is no `PostToolUse` hook: it would fire on every tool call.
5. **The Codex app-server.** An observer can't reach the app-server of a session it didn't start: the app-server speaks JSON-RPC over the owning client's stdio. So the adapter takes `{waitingOnApproval, waitingOnUserInput}` through a `CodexStatusProbe` port, and the v1 probe returns `null`. Codex approvals come from the `PermissionRequest` hook in the spool, and from `*_approval_request` rollout events when present. The state rules honour the flags (tested), so a later probe plugs in without any rule change.
6. **Tokens and cost.** `scorer live` reads no prices (`scorer/src/live-snapshot.ts`). For live Claude sessions:
   - tokens come from `scorer live --json` (`usage.contextTokens + usage.outputTokens`), cached 60 s, with at most 20 refreshes per pass;
   - dollars come from the newest `cost-state` line in the transcript (`totalCostUSD`).

   Codex tokens come from the rollout's newest `token_count.info.total_token_usage.total_tokens`. Cursor shows neither. All figures are per session ("this session"), and Today sums the sessions updated since local midnight.
7. **Bridge unread.** `GET /messages/unread` marks messages as read, so the collector never calls it. Instead it counts `messages WHERE recipient = <profile user> AND read_at IS NULL` in the bridge's SQLite file, opened query-only (`AW_BRIDGE_DB`, default `<toolkit repo>/mcp-bridge/bridge.db`).
8. **`fleet.sources` has six switches:** `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `sindri`, `gh` and `bridge`. The spec names the provider adapters; the needs-you sources get switches too, so a builder without gh or the bridge can turn them off.
9. **The heavy-lock queue.** Waiters weren't recorded anywhere. Now `withHeavyLock` writes `<lock>.queue/<pid>-<ulid>.json` while it waits and removes it when it stops waiting. Waiters that use `config/lib/locks.sh` directly don't appear, and the docs say so.
10. **Job results.** Index builds, `observe`, the weekly job, `evolve check`, scope runs, `shape reconcile` and `doctor` didn't keep their outcomes. Now `runCli` records each run of those commands under `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/jobs/`: start, end, exit code and one scrubbed summary line (the weekly job keeps up to 8 lines, one per step). A record with no end whose process is gone (pid or start time) is `crashed`.
11. **Acknowledge and "seen".** `sindri fleet ack <key>` is a new safe action that writes `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/acks.json`.
    - It hides a failure item until that failure happens again.
    - It marks a `ready` session's "done" marker as seen (key `done:<provider>:<id>`). The dashboard sends it when the builder opens that agent.

    Park and unpark aren't in the action list: no CLI verb exists for them until the Sindri runner (rollout step 3a).
12. **Tokens for the menu bar.** SwiftBar can run a command but can't mint a token, so a new `sindri dashboard --open <path>` mints a one-time URL for a deep link and opens it. How tokens work:
    - `sindri dashboard` writes `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/server.json` (mode 0600), holding the pid, its start time, the port and an HMAC key made fresh on every restart.
    - `--url` and `--open` mint `nonce.expiry.hmac` tokens with that key.
    - The server accepts each nonce once, within 10 minutes.
    - A restart means a new key, so every old token and session cookie stops working.
13. **Over an ssh tunnel.** The Host check needs the same port number on both ends (`ssh -L 7190:127.0.0.1:7190 box`). The server knows it's running remotely from `SSH_CONNECTION` in its environment, and attach then shows the local command instead of launching anything.
14. **"Notifications sent" (Today).** Sindri sends no notifications of its own yet, so the Today view counts the OS notifications this dashboard tab has fired.
15. **A new Warp tab running a command.** Warp's URL scheme can't run a command in a new tab directly. So the launcher writes one launch configuration, `~/.warp/launch_configurations/sindri-attach.yaml`, and opens `warp://launch/sindri-attach.yaml`. Warp's folder isn't a provider store, and adapters still never write into provider folders.
16. **Needs-you order.** Items sort by category first, in the spec's list order (waiting sessions, decisions, failures, PRs, bridge), then by state priority, then oldest first.
17. **Sessions outside onboarded repos.** They're grouped under "Other", by their git top-level, or by their cwd when there's no git.

## Global Constraints

- **Language and checks.** Node >= 20.11, TypeScript 5.7 strict, ESM (Node16), no `any`, no `/* v8 ignore */`. New sindri code has 100% coverage. The coverage excludes this plan adds, each a thin wiring file exercised elsewhere:
  - `src/fleet/proc-real.ts` (ps and lsof; smoke-tested in `tests/real.test.ts`);
  - `src/dashboard/io-real.ts` (the signal wait and the browser opener);
  - `ui/src/app.ts` (DOM glue, run by real Chromium in `tests/browser/`).

  `ui/src/model.ts` is inside the coverage gate. If `test:coverage` names a line or branch that a task's listed tests miss (for example, a fallback for a status record with an empty `name`), add a focused test to that task's test file before committing. Never add an ignore comment.
- **Read-only toward providers.** No code writes into `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` or `~/.cursor`. `sindri fleet` opens the ledger query-only and never writes it. It writes only under `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/`, and `sindri dashboard` only under `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/`.
- **Bounded.** Each pass reads:
  - at most 1 MiB from the end of each transcript;
  - at most 200 sessions per source, newest first;
  - for at most 2 s per source;
  - only files changed in the last 24 h, except for sessions whose process is alive.
- **Contained.** Every source runs inside `runSource`. A throw becomes an `SND-FLEET-001` entry for that source alone, and a source that runs out of budget is marked `truncated` with `SND-FLEET-002`.
- **Scrubbed and escaped.** Every agent-written string is scrubbed, capped and escaped in the collector, through `cleanLine` or `cleanText` (profile scrubber, then `escapeInvisible`). The browser renders it with `textContent` only, and escapes again with `visible()` as defence in depth.
- **Private data.** Code, fixtures and docs hold no workplace names, paths or text. Fixtures are synthetic (`/Users/dev/acme.web`, "Fix the login form"). The end-to-end screenshots of real sessions stay under `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/evidence/`: they are never committed, never attached to the PR, and never posted.
- **Security** follows spec §6 exactly:
  - it binds `127.0.0.1` only;
  - a taken port is an error that names the port and `dashboard.port`;
  - one-time tokens are exchanged for an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie;
  - every request needs a `Host` of `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`, and every action also needs a matching `Origin` and a CSRF token;
  - no CORS headers are sent;
  - the CSP is `default-src 'self'`, with no inline script or style and `frame-ancestors 'none'`, plus `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
  - actions are a fixed argv list with checked arguments, run with no shell;
  - terminal-gated commands are shown, never run.
- **The hook** never blocks, never prints to the host and always exits 0.
- **The CLI output contract** (main spec §10.3): state words first, no colour, `--json` on every subcommand, exit codes 0/1/2, and a closing `Next: <command>` line whenever there is one. `sindri fleet` exits 1 when something needs you.
- **Error codes** are registered in the task that first uses them, because `tests/errors.test.ts` checks both directions. After every change to `errors.ts` or `schema.ts`, run `cd sindri && npm run gen` and commit `docs/sindri/errors.md`, `docs/sindri/profile.md` and `sindri/schema/*.json`.
- **One heavy job at a time on the box.** Another session may hold the heavy lock.
  - While you iterate, run only the task's own vitest files.
  - Run `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage` once per task, right before its commit.
  - The Playwright files are part of `npm test` (Task 10 onward).
  - Never run two of these at once, and skip `npm install` unless a dependency is actually missing. The one new dependency is `playwright` in Task 10.
- **Tracking and commits.** Tick each step's checkbox in this plan file in the same commit that completes it. Commit format `type: short description`, ending with the session's attribution trailer (written below as `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`).

## Review Focus

1. **A huge or half-written transcript.** Take a 50 MB Claude transcript whose last line is still being written (no newline yet). The adapter must:
   - read only the last 1 MiB;
   - drop the partial first and last lines;
   - never throw;
   - still give the session a state.

   Pinned in Task 1 (`readTail`) and Task 2 (`discoverClaude` on a 5 MiB file with a torn last line).
2. **A recycled pid.** `sessions/4242.json` names pid 4242, but 4242 now belongs to another program.
   - The record's `procStart` doesn't match `pidStartTime(4242)`, so the session isn't live. It shows as `crashed` or `ended` from its transcript, and attach never focuses the wrong window.
   - Codex liveness comes from whichever process holds the rollout file open, not from a pid file.
   - Cursor liveness is labelled `estimated`.

   Pinned in Tasks 2 and 3, with the attach side in Task 11.
3. **Many hundreds of sessions, or a provider directory that doesn't exist.** With 900 transcripts across 60 project dirs, one pass reads at most 200 per source, newest first. It stops at the 2 s budget and reports `truncated` with `SND-FLEET-002` in that source's entry. Also:
   - a missing `~/.codex` is an empty source, not an error;
   - a corrupt `sessions/*.json` or an unreadable Cursor `meta.json` affects only its own row;
   - a throwing source leaves the others intact.

   Pinned in Task 8 (`collectFleet`), with the adapter halves in Tasks 2 and 3.
4. **A burst of hook events.** Thirty hooks fire within a second (a fan-out of subagents).
   - Every hook returns at once, because the CLI runs detached.
   - Each event becomes exactly one whole spool line of at most 4 KiB.
   - Rotation at 1 MiB never leaves a line the reader can't skip.
   - A 10 MB `PermissionRequest` payload (a big Write) still records one short line.

   Pinned in Task 5.
5. **The tab left open for days, the server restarted, the clock moved back.**
   - Polling never stacks timers or grows the DOM.
   - After a server restart every request gets a 401. The page says "run `sindri dashboard --url`" once and stops polling.
   - Three failed polls in a row show "sindri not responding: run `sindri doctor`".
   - A transcript timestamp in the future (because the clock moved back) never counts as a recent write and never makes a session `stuck`, and ages never go negative.

   Pinned in Task 6 (rules) and Task 10 (Playwright: hundreds of fast polls, then a real restart).

### Task 1: Fleet types, limits, the text sanitizer, the bounded tail reader and the profile keys

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/types.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/limits.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/paths.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/text.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/tail.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/profile/schema.ts`
- Generated: `docs/sindri/profile.md`, `sindri/schema/profile.schema.json` (`npm run gen`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-fixtures.ts` (shared), `sindri/tests/fleet-text.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-tail.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-profile.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `escapeInvisible` (`src/evolve/invisible.ts`), `Scrubber`/`makeScrubber` (`src/scrub/scrub.ts`), `stateDir` (`src/deps.ts`), `ProcessRunner` (`src/index/io.ts`), `Ledger`, `LoadedProfile`.
- Produces:
  - `FleetSchema` and `DashboardSchema` (exported from `schema.ts`). They add the profile keys `fleet.stuckMinutes` (10, an integer from 1 to 1440), `fleet.sources.{claude,codex,cursor,sindri,gh,bridge}` (all `true`), `dashboard.port` (7190, from 1024 to 65535) and `dashboard.notify` (`true`).
  - `types.ts`:
    - the constants and their types: `PROVIDERS`/`Provider`, `isProvider`, `HOSTS`/`Host`, `STATES`/`FleetState`, `stateRank`, `SOURCES`/`SourceName`;
    - the spool types `SpoolKind`, `SpoolEvent`, `SpoolSummary`;
    - the session types `TerminalReason`, `ApiError`, `SessionSignals`, `emptySignals()`, `TimelineEntry`, `Session`;
    - the IO types `ProcEntry`, `ProcessTable { list(); cwds(pids); holders(files) }`, `CodexStatusProbe`, `FleetIo`;
    - the context types `FleetConfig`, `FleetCtx`, `Discovery`, and the helper `spoolKey(provider, id)`.
  - `limits.ts`: `MAX_TAIL_BYTES` (1 MiB), `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_SOURCE` (200), `MAX_CHILDREN` (50), `RECENT_MS` (24 h), `SOURCE_BUDGET_MS` (2000), `RECENT_WRITE_MS` (60 s), `FUTURE_SLACK_MS` (2 min), `SPOOL_MAX_BYTES` (1 MiB), `SPOOL_LINE_MAX` (4096), `MAX_HOOK_PAYLOAD` (4 MiB), `USAGE_TTL_MS` (60 s), `MAX_USAGE_CALLS` (20), `GH_TTL_MS` (120 s), `JUDGE_TTL_MS` (300 s).
  - `paths.ts`: `fleetDir(deps)`, `dashboardDir(deps)`, `providerHomes(deps)` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME` honoured), `isUnder(p, root)`, `iso(ms)`, `latestIso(...ts)`.
  - `text.ts`: `cleanLine(raw, max, scrubber)` (one line) and `cleanText(raw, max, scrubber)` (newlines kept). Both scrub, cap by code points and escape every control or invisible character as `\u{XXXX}`. Caps: `MAX_TITLE` 120, `MAX_ACTIVITY` 160, `MAX_DETAIL` 240, `MAX_TIMELINE` 400.
  - `tail.ts`: `readTail(file, maxBytes?)` returns `{ lines, truncated, size, mtimeMs, partialLast } | null`, with whole lines only. Also `readHead(file, maxBytes?)` (the first line or `null`) and `parseJsonLines(lines)` (`{ entries, bad }`).
  - Test helpers in `fleet-fixtures.ts`:
    - the clock and ids: `NOW`, `at(secondsAgo)`, `CWD`, `SID`, `SID2`;
    - file writers: `writeFile`, `jsonl`, `claudeSlug`;
    - `L`, which builds real-shaped Claude transcript lines;
    - `claudeStatusFile` and `claudeTranscript`;
    - fakes and contexts: `fakeProcTable`, `fleetIo`, `fleetCtx`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`sindri/tests/fleet-fixtures.ts` (shared by every fleet test; later tasks append builders to it):

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

import type { Deps } from "../src/deps.js";
import type { FleetCtx, FleetIo, ProcEntry, ProcessTable, SpoolSummary } from "../src/fleet/types.js";
import { FleetSchema } from "../src/profile/schema.js";
import { makeScrubber } from "../src/scrub/scrub.js";
import { makeDeps } from "./helpers.js";

export const NOW = new Date("2026-10-08T12:00:00.000Z"); // makeDeps' clock
export const at = (secondsAgo: number): string => new Date(NOW.getTime() - secondsAgo * 1000).toISOString();
export const CWD = "/Users/dev/acme.web"; // synthetic; adapters never stat a session's cwd
export const SID = "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111";
export const SID2 = "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222";

export function writeFile(file: string, text: string, mtime?: Date): string {
  fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(file), { recursive: true });
  fs.writeFileSync(file, text);
  if (mtime !== undefined) fs.utimesSync(file, mtime, mtime);
  return file;
}

export const jsonl = (objs: readonly unknown[]): string => objs.map((o) => JSON.stringify(o)).join("\n") + (objs.length > 0 ? "\n" : "");

Trace for the giant-line case: the 3000-byte file has no newline, `start = 2000`, so `split` gives one element. `truncated` drops index 0 and `slice(…, -1)` drops the last one: `lines = []`, and `partialLast` is true because the last element is non-empty.

Regenerate the docs: `cd sindri && npm run gen` (writes `docs/sindri/profile.md`, `sindri/schema/profile.schema.json` and `repo.schema.json`; `errors.md` is unchanged).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-text.test.ts tests/fleet-tail.test.ts tests/fleet-profile.test.ts tests/profile-doc.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, and coverage stays at 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet sindri/src/profile/schema.ts sindri/tests docs/sindri/profile.md sindri/schema
git commit -m "feat: sindri fleet types, text sanitizer, bounded tail reader and profile keys" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 2: The process table and the Claude Code adapter

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/proc.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/proc-real.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/adapters/claude.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/vitest.config.ts` (exclude `src/fleet/proc-real.ts`), `sindri/tests/real.test.ts` (smoke test)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-proc.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-claude.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - from Task 1: `FleetCtx`, `Session`, `SessionSignals`, `emptySignals`, `Discovery`, `readTail`, `parseJsonLines`, `cleanLine`, `cleanText`, `providerHomes`, `isUnder`, `iso`, `latestIso`, limits;
  - existing code: `textBlocks`, `toolNames` (`src/evolve/transcripts.ts`), `SystemProbe.pidAlive`/`pidStartTime`.
- Produces:
  - `proc.ts`:
    - `parsePs(out): ProcEntry[]`, for `ps -axo pid=,ppid=,tty=,lstart=,command=`;
    - `normStart(s)` and `sameStart(a, b)`, which compare with whitespace collapsed;
    - `ancestorsOf(procs, pid, depth?)`, the chain starting at `pid` itself;
    - `hostFromAncestors(chain): Host | null`, which recognises T3 Code, Warp, tmux, Cursor, Terminal and iTerm;
    - `parseLsofCwds(out)` and `parseLsofHolders(out)`.
  - `proc-real.ts`: `realProcessTable(): ProcessTable`, built from one `ps` call and batched `lsof` calls under `LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC`, with a 3 s timeout each.
  - `adapters/claude.ts`:
    - `UUID`;
    - `readStatusFiles(ctx): Map<sessionId, StatusRecord>`. A record is live only when the pid is alive **and** `pidStartTime(pid)` matches `procStart`.
    - `claudeSignals(entries, scrubber): ParsedClaude`, which returns the signals, title, first prompt, activity, cost, turn start, prompt times, timeline, cwd, entrypoint and last stop reason;
    - `toolLabel(name, input)`, `apiErrorOf(text, error)` and `hostOf(entrypoint, cwd, home, chain)`;
    - `discoverClaude(ctx): Discovery`, which covers live sessions and transcripts changed in the last 24 h, newest first, capped at 200, under the budget, with subagents as children (`parentId`).

Traces for the tests:
- **The budget test.** `overBudget` returns false three times, so three transcripts are read, and on the fourth check it stops. The live status record (SID) has a transcript that wasn't read in this pass, so it's added by the trailing loop: four sessions, `truncated: true`.
- **The cap test.** 206 transcripts qualify (205 recent, plus SID because it is live); SID2 is old and dead, so it's dropped. The newest 200 are kept, and SID (90 000 s old) falls outside them. The trailing loop then adds SID with no transcript, because it's live, which makes 201. SID2 has no status record, so it never appears.
- **The dead-pid test.** There's no transcript and the record is dead, so the trailing loop adds it because no transcript names it.

In `sindri/vitest.config.ts`, add `"src/fleet/proc-real.ts"` to `coverage.exclude`, with the comment `// ps/lsof wiring; smoke-tested in tests/real.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-proc.test.ts tests/fleet-claude.test.ts tests/real.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet sindri/tests sindri/vitest.config.ts
git commit -m "feat: sindri fleet process table and Claude Code adapter" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 3: The Codex and Cursor adapters

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/adapters/codex.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/adapters/cursor.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/tests/fleet-fixtures.ts` (Codex and Cursor builders)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-codex.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-cursor.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - from Task 1: `FleetCtx`, `Session`, `emptySignals`, `readTail`, `readHead`, `parseJsonLines`, `cleanLine`, `cleanText`, `providerHomes`, `iso`, `latestIso`, `isUnder`, limits;
  - from Task 2: `ancestorsOf`, `hostFromAncestors`, `apiErrorOf`, `toolLabel`, `UUID`;
  - `FleetIo.proc.holders`/`cwds` and `FleetIo.codex`.
- Produces:
  - `codex.ts`:
    - `codexMeta(head)` returns `{ id, parent, guardian, originator, cwd }`;
    - `codexSignals(entries, scrubber)` returns `ParsedCodex`: the signals, title, activity, tokens, turn start, prompt times, timeline, cwd, first timestamp, `waitingOnApproval` and `waitingOnUserInput`;
    - `discoverCodex(ctx): Discovery`. A session is alive when a process holds its rollout file open (one batched `lsof` per pass). Flags from `FleetIo.codex.status(id)` win when the probe answers (spec decision 5). Subagent rollouts get `parentId`, and the approvals "guardian" is skipped. A row is `estimated` unless the spool or the probe has spoken for it.
  - `cursor.ts`:
    - `cursorSignals(entries, mtimeIso, scrubber)`;
    - `discoverCursor(ctx): Discovery`, reading `~/.cursor/chats/*/<id>/meta.json`, the matching `~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/<id>/<id>.jsonl` (or a spool transcript path, but only one inside `~/.cursor`) and `prompt_history.json`. Liveness comes from a `cursor-agent` process whose cwd matches; when several chats share that cwd, only the newest counts as alive. Every row is `estimated` unless the spool has events for it.
  - Fixture builders: `CX`, `codexRollout`, `CU`, `cursorChat`, `cursorTranscript`.

Trace for the spool test: the chat has no `agent-transcripts` entry of its own. The spool's path `…/.cursor/projects/other/agent-transcripts/x/x.jsonl` is inside `~/.cursor`, so it is read. The stop status `aborted` sets `aborted_streaming`. With `/etc/hosts` the path is outside `~/.cursor` and is refused, leaving `transcript: null`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-codex.test.ts tests/fleet-cursor.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet sindri/tests

### Task 4: Sindri jobs: job records from `runCli`, the heavy-lock queue and repo status

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/jobs.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/adapters/sindri.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/main.ts` (record jobs around `command.run`), `sindri/src/index/heavy-lock.ts` (waiter records, `heavyLockQueue`), `sindri/src/fleet/types.ts` (add `PrView`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-jobs.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-sindri.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/heavy-lock-queue.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - from Tasks 1–2: `fleetDir`, `cleanLine`, `sameStart`, `readTail`, `parseJsonLines`, `FleetCtx`;
  - existing code: `ulid`, `CommandResult`, `makeScrubber`, `heavyLockState`, `heavyLockDir`, `awStateDir`, `openIndexReadOnly`, `indexPath`, `meta` (index), `Ledger`, `GitRunner`.
- Produces:
  - `jobs.ts`:
    - `JobRecord`, `JobState = "running" | "ok" | "attn" | "failed" | "crashed"`, `JobView`;
    - `jobKindOf(name, rest)`: `observe` (not `--no-record`), `doctor`, `index build` (`index-build:<repo|all>` or `index-quick:<repo|all>`), `evolve weekly`/`check` (`evolve-weekly`, `evolve-check`), `scope <brief|linear:…>` (`scope`) and `shape reconcile` (`shape-reconcile`). It returns null for `--help`, `--dry-run`, `--list` and every other command;
    - `startJob(deps, name, rest): JobHandle | null` and `finishJob(deps, handle, result)`. The summary is one scrubbed line, or up to 8 for `evolve-weekly` (its steps). Neither ever throws: a failure goes to `deps.log`;
    - `jobState(rec, sys)`, `readJobs(deps): JobView[]` (the latest run per kind) and `jobHistory(deps, limit?)`.
    - Files: `fleet/jobs/latest/<kind>.json` (`:` becomes `__`) and `fleet/jobs/history.jsonl`, which rotates at 1 MiB into `history.1.jsonl`. All are written 0600, and `latest` atomically.
  - `heavy-lock.ts`: `withHeavyLock` writes `<lock>.queue/<pid>-<ulid>.json` (`{ kind, pid, host, since }`) from its first wait until it stops waiting. `heavyLockQueue(stateRoot, env, sys): QueueEntry[]` returns the waiters oldest first, with dead ones on this host dropped.
  - `types.ts`: `PrView { repo; number; title; url; draft; reviewDecision; mergeState; author; requestedMe; readyToMerge; createdAt }`.
  - `adapters/sindri.ts`:
    - `HeavyLockView`, `RepoIndexView`, `RepoView`, `ScopeRunView`, `SindriReport`;
    - `discoverSindri(ctx): Promise<SindriReport>`, returning the latest job per kind, the history, the lock holder and queue, the scope runs, and per approved repo: index age, last build job, file and symbol counts, commits behind `HEAD`, staleness, last observe and backlog for the tracker repo, and the scope runs whose output lies in that repo. `prs` and `worktrees` stay empty here; Tasks 7 and 8 fill them.

`sindri/src/main.ts`: import `{ finishJob, startJob }` from `./fleet/jobs.js`, and change the tail of `runCli` to:

```ts

  // Spec decision 10: job commands leave a record (start, end, exit code) for the dashboard.
  const job = startJob(deps, name, rest);

    finishJob(deps, job, r);
    return r;
  } catch (e) {
    // Commands render SindriErrors themselves; anything reaching here is a bug.
    // Invariant 8: no secrets in output (launchd logs stderr). Built-in patterns
    // only: the profile may be what broke.
    const { scrub } = makeScrubber();
    const message = scrub(e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)).text;
    const details = deps.env.SINDRI_DEBUG === "1" && e instanceof Error ? scrub(e.stack ?? "").text.split("\n") : [];
    const r = failure("SND-CLI-900", `unexpected error: ${message}`, json, { details });
    finishJob(deps, job, r);
    return r;
  }
```

Add a test to `sindri/tests/main.test.ts`, beside the existing `SND-CLI-900` crash test, covering the crash branch's `finishJob`:

```ts
  it("records a crashed job command as failed", async () => {
    const deps = makeDeps();
    const saved = COMMANDS.doctor;
    COMMANDS.doctor = { ...saved, run: async () => { throw new TypeError("kaboom"); } };
    try {
      expect((await runCli(["doctor"], deps)).exitCode).toBe(2);
      expect(readJobs(deps)).toMatchObject([{ kind: "doctor", state: "failed", exitCode: 2 }]);
    } finally {
      COMMANDS.doctor = saved;
    }
  });
```

(Import `readJobs` from `../src/fleet/jobs.js` there.)

`sindri/src/index/heavy-lock.ts`: add after `heavyLockState`:

```ts
export interface QueueEntry {
  kind: string;
  pid: number;
  host: string;
  since: string;
}
const QueueSchema = z.object({ kind: z.string(), pid: z.number().int(), host: z.string(), since: z.string() });
const queueDir = (dir: string): string => `${dir}.queue`;

// Spec decision 9: a waiter leaves a record beside the lock while it waits. Best effort: a waiter that
// can't write one still waits.
function enqueue(dir: string, me: HeavyHolder, now: Date): string | null {
  try {
    fs.mkdirSync(queueDir(dir), { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 });
    const file = path.join(queueDir(dir), `${me.pid}-${ulid(now)}.json`);
    fs.writeFileSync(file, JSON.stringify({ kind: me.kind, pid: me.pid, host: me.host, since: now.toISOString() }), { mode: 0o600 });
    return file;
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}

export function heavyLockQueue(stateRoot: string, env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv, sys: SystemProbe): QueueEntry[] {
  const q = queueDir(heavyLockDir(stateRoot, env));
  let names: string[];
  try {
    names = fs.readdirSync(q).filter((n) => n.endsWith(".json"));
  } catch {
    return [];
  }
  return names
    .flatMap((n) => {
      try {
        const r = QueueSchema.safeParse(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(q, n), "utf8")));
        return r.success ? [r.data] : [];
      } catch {
        return [];
      }
    })
    .filter((e) => e.host !== sys.hostname() || sys.pidAlive(e.pid))
    .sort((a, b) => a.since.localeCompare(b.since));
}
```

In `withHeavyLock`, wrap the acquisition loop so the waiter record is written on the first wait and always removed:

```ts
  let queued: string | null = null;
  try {
    for (let i = 1; ; i++) {
      // … the existing body, unchanged, except the first-wait branch:
      if (i === 1) {
        deps.log(`waiting for the heavy-job lock${who}`);
        queued = enqueue(dir, me, deps.now());
      }
      await deps.sleep(1000);
    }
  } finally {
    if (queued !== null) fs.rmSync(queued, { force: true });
  }
```

The test's `"Brief with \u001b[31mcolour"` subject goes into the ledger raw. `cleanLine` escapes ESC as `\u{001B}`, which is what the view shows. Rows that `path.join` builds are always absolute, so `isUnder` decides by path alone. `ScopeRunView.outPath` is internal; the UI never shows it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-jobs.test.ts tests/heavy-lock-queue.test.ts tests/fleet-sindri.test.ts tests/heavy-lock.test.ts tests/main.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests
git commit -m "feat: sindri job records, heavy-lock queue and repo status for the fleet" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5: The `aw:fleet` hook, the spool and per-provider install

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/spool.ts`, `config/hooks/fleet.sh` (executable), `config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh`
- Modify:
  - `scripts/install-sindri.sh`: `aw:fleet` for every installed provider on a plain install, `--fleet-hook [--provider X]`, and the `AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK` and `AW_FLEET_PROVIDERS` variables;
  - `scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`;
  - `config/hooks/adapters/README.md` (the mapping row);
  - `.agents/rules/hooks.md` (hook table and a "Fleet hook" section);
  - `AGENTS.md` (the bash test line, and the `config/` comment).
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-spool.test.ts`, the bash tests above

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fleetDir`, `cleanLine`, `MAX_DETAIL`, `readTail`, `parseJsonLines`, `isProvider`, `PROVIDERS`, `spoolKey`, the spool types and limits (Task 1); `makeScrubber`; `Deps.stdin`; `install-lib.sh` (`aw_hooks_init`, `aw_hooks_stage`, `aw_hook_set`); the Codex and Cursor adapters, which export `AW_HOOK_PROVIDER` to the canonical script.
- Produces:
  - `spool.ts`:
    - `eventFromPayload(provider, raw, now, scrubber): SpoolEvent | null`, mapping hook payloads (Claude-shaped, as the adapters normalise them) to spool kinds;
    - `headFields(head)`, which pulls the routing fields out of a payload too big or too broken to parse;
    - `spoolFile(deps, provider, rotated?)`;
    - `appendSpool(deps, ev)`: one `write` of one line of at most 4 KiB, 0600, rotating to `<provider>.1.jsonl` at 1 MiB;
    - `runHook(provider, deps): Promise<void>`, which never throws and writes nothing for an unknown provider or an event it doesn't keep;
    - `readSpool(deps, since, scrubber): SpoolEvent[]`, in file order, rotated file first, re-scrubbed with the given (profile) scrubber, and only from the last 24 h;
    - `summarize(events): Map<spoolKey, SpoolSummary>`.
  - Spool kinds:
    - `PermissionRequest` gives `permission`;
    - `Notification` gives `permission` (`notification_type: permission_prompt`, or "needs your permission" text), `question` (`elicitation_dialog`) or a plain `notification`, which has no effect;
    - `PreToolUse` gives `question` for `AskUserQuestion` or `request_user_input`, and `plan` for `ExitPlanMode`;
    - `Stop` gives `stop` (with `bg`, the number of running `background_tasks`, and Cursor's `status` as the detail);
    - `UserPromptSubmit` gives `prompt`, `PreCompact` gives `compact`, and `SessionEnd` gives `session-end`;
    - `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` give `subagent-start` and `subagent-stop` (with `agent`).
  - `config/hooks/fleet.sh`: saves stdin to a 0600 temp file, runs `sindri fleet hook "${AW_HOOK_PROVIDER:-claude}"` detached with its output discarded, prints nothing and exits 0 at once. It does nothing for `AW_JUDGE_CHILD` or `AW_SINDRI_CHILD` sessions, without sindri, or for an unknown provider. (The `sindri fleet hook` command itself is registered in Task 8 and calls `runHook`.)
  - `install-sindri.sh`:
    - a plain install installs `aw:fleet` for every installed provider: Claude if `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}` exists; Codex if `codex` is on `PATH` or `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}` exists; Cursor if `cursor-agent` is on `PATH` or `~/.cursor` exists. `AW_FLEET_PROVIDERS="claude cursor"` overrides the detection, and `AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK=1` skips it;
    - `--fleet-hook --provider X` installs it for one provider;
    - events: Claude gets `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`, `SessionEnd` and `PreToolUse` (matcher `AskUserQuestion|ExitPlanMode`). Codex gets the same minus `Notification` and `PreToolUse`. Cursor gets `stop`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop`, `beforeSubmitPrompt` and `preCompact`;
    - every entry ends in `# aw:fleet` and has a 5 s timeout.

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-spool.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../src/fleet/spool.js`.

Trace for the oversized-line test: the detail is 240 escaped NULs, 9 characters each as `\\u{0000}` (about 2.4 KiB once JSON-escaped), and the transcript is 2001 bytes, so the line passes 4 KiB. The retry drops `transcript` and keeps 200 characters of the detail (about 220 bytes), well under the cap. (`eventFromPayload` itself never makes a transcript path over 512 bytes; the test calls `appendSpool` directly to prove the guard.)

`scripts/install-sindri.sh`:
- Header comment: add these lines:
  - `install-sindri.sh --fleet-hook [--provider claude|codex|cursor]` installs only the aw:fleet hook for that host (default claude).
  - A plain install adds aw:fleet for every installed provider. `AW_FLEET_PROVIDERS="claude cursor"` overrides the detection, and `AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK=1` skips it.
- `USAGE`: becomes `usage: install-sindri.sh [--hook-only|--fleet-hook [--provider claude|codex|cursor]] | [--channel stable|next [--ref <sha>]]`.
- The argument loop: add `--fleet-hook) FLEET_ONLY=1; shift ;;` (with `FLEET_ONLY=0` declared beside `HOOK_ONLY=0`).
- The flag checks: add `if [ "$FLEET_ONLY" = "1" ] && { [ "$HOOK_ONLY" = "1" ] || [ -n "$CHANNEL" ]; }; then echo "$USAGE" >&2; exit 1; fi`.
- Then add, after `write_wrapper`:

```bash
# The events aw:fleet listens to, per provider (config/hooks/adapters/README.md). "Event=matcher" pairs.
fleet_events() {
  case "$1" in
    claude) echo "PermissionRequest Notification Stop SubagentStart SubagentStop UserPromptSubmit PreCompact SessionEnd PreToolUse=AskUserQuestion|ExitPlanMode" ;;

  esac
}

}

  if [ "${AW_DRY_RUN:-0}" = "1" ]; then
    echo "  [dry-run] would install aw:fleet ($list) for $p in $AW_HOOKS_CONFIG"
    return 0
  fi
  if [ "$p" = "claude" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$AW_HOOKS_INSTALL_DIR"
    cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/config/hooks/fleet.sh" "$AW_HOOKS_INSTALL_DIR/fleet.sh"

    aw_hook_set "$ev" aw:fleet fleet.sh "$matcher" 5
  done
  echo "  sindri: aw:fleet hook installed for $p in $AW_HOOKS_CONFIG"
}
```

- Right after the `--hook-only` block, add:

```bash
if [ "$FLEET_ONLY" = "1" ]; then
  install_fleet_hook "$AW_PROVIDER"
  exit 0
fi
```

- In the plain-install dry-run branch, before its `exit 0`, and in the real branch after the wrapper is written, add:

```bash
if [ "${AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK:-0}" != "1" ]; then
  for P in $(installed_providers); do install_fleet_hook "$P"; done
fi
```

The functions must be defined above both branches, so put them right after `write_wrapper`. A `for ev in $(…)` loop splits on spaces only, so the `|` inside the matcher survives.

`config/hooks/adapters/README.md`, mapping table: add the row

```
| `fleet.sh` | PermissionRequest, Notification, Stop, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, SessionEnd, PreToolUse `AskUserQuestion\|ExitPlanMode` (`install-sindri.sh`) | PermissionRequest, Stop, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, SessionEnd (`--provider codex`) | `stop`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `preCompact`; no permission or question event, so Cursor states stay `estimated` |
```

`.agents/rules/hooks.md`:
- Add `fleet.sh` to the Hook Files table: `| fleet.sh | Spool (many events) | — |`.
- Add `config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh` to the test list.
- Add a section:

```markdown
## Fleet hook (sindri dashboard)

`fleet.sh` (`# aw:fleet`) appends one line per hook event to `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/spool/<provider>.jsonl` through `sindri fleet hook <provider>`: provider, session, event, time, and a short scrubbed detail (never the tool input). It's the authoritative "waiting on you" signal for `sindri fleet` and the dashboard. It saves stdin to a 0600 temp file, runs the CLI detached with its output discarded, prints nothing, and exits 0 at once, so it can't block or fail a turn. It does nothing in `AW_JUDGE_CHILD` / `AW_SINDRI_CHILD` sessions or without sindri. A plain `scripts/install-sindri.sh` installs it for every installed provider (`AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK=1` skips it); `--fleet-hook --provider X` installs one. The events per provider are in `config/hooks/adapters/README.md`.
```

`AGENTS.md`:
- Under Commands, add `bash config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh` after the `sindri-nudge` test line.
- In the directory tree, extend the `config/` comment to `… sindri-nudge SessionStart hook, aw:fleet spool hook (+ hooks/adapters/ per provider)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-spool.test.ts`, then from the repo root `bash config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh && bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh && bash config/hooks/tests/provider-install-hooks.test.sh`.
Expected: all PASS. Then, once for the task: `cd sindri && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet/spool.ts sindri/tests/fleet-spool.test.ts config/hooks/fleet.sh config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh config/hooks/adapters/README.md scripts/install-sindri.sh scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh .agents/rules/hooks.md AGENTS.md

### Task 6: State rules (pure, table-driven) and the subagent roll-up

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/state.ts`
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-state.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Session`, `SessionSignals`, `SpoolEvent`, `FleetState`, `stateRank`, `RECENT_WRITE_MS`, `FUTURE_SLACK_MS` (Task 1); `claudeSignals` (Task 2) and `summarize` (Task 5), both only in the tests, which build signals from real-shaped event sequences.
- Produces:
  - `Derived { state; reason }` and `StatedSession = Session & Derived & { children: StatedSession[]; childCount: number }`.
  - `ageMs(ts, now): number | null`. It never goes negative. A timestamp more than 2 min in the future (the clock moved back) has no known age.
  - `pendingOf(signals): SpoolEvent | null` (spec decision 4).
  - `deriveState({ alive, signals }, now, stuckMinutes): Derived`: exactly one of the spec §4.3 states, with a reason in words.
    - **Alive:**
      1. `approval`: Codex `waitingOnApproval`, a pending spool permission, or the status file's `waiting`;
      2. `input`: Codex `waitingOnUserInput`, a pending spool question, or an open `AskUserQuestion`;
      3. `plan ready`;
      4. `auth`;
      5. `working`: a write in the last 60 s; busy with recent output; busy while background tasks run; or compacting;
      6. `stuck`: busy with no output for more than `stuckMinutes`;
      7. `background`: idle while background tasks or subagents will wake it;
      8. `limited`, then `failed` (only once the turn has ended), then `interrupted`, then `ready`.
    - **Gone:** `crashed` (the turn never closed, or the process stopped mid-tool-call), then `interrupted`, `limited`, `failed`, `ended`.
  - `rollUp(sessions): StatedSession[]`. Children hide under their parent (one level). `childCount` counts live children. A live child in `approval` or `input` raises the parent's state, with its reason quoted. A `ready` parent with running children becomes `background`. An orphan child (its parent wasn't discovered) shows at the top level.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```

Traces:
- **The clock-moved-back row:** both lines are in the future beyond the slack, so `writeAge` is null and so is `outAge`; busy is true, so the session is `working` and never `stuck`.
- **The "write in the last minute" row:** `busy: false` from the status file, but the write 30 s ago wins, so it's `working`.
- **The 529 row:** the result line sets `terminalReason: "completed"`, but `apiError` survives (only a new human prompt clears it), so the session is `failed` with "API error 529".
- **The "gone mid-tool-call" row:** the process is dead and the `Bash` tool_use has no result.
- **The orphan row of `rollUp`:** a Claude child whose parent id names a Codex session isn't a child of it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-state.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (33 rows plus the coverage row and the helper tests). Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet/state.ts sindri/tests/fleet-state.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: sindri fleet state rules and subagent roll-up" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 7: The needs-you aggregator: decisions, failures, gh PRs (cached), bridge unread, acks

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/decisions.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/gh.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/bridge.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/acks.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/needs.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/evolve/cmd/channel.ts` (export `suiteRunAt`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-needs.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-decisions.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-gh.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-bridge.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - from Tasks 1–6: `StatedSession`, `stateRank`, `JobView`, `RepoView`, `PrView`, `fleetDir`, `cleanLine`, `GH_TTL_MS`, `JUDGE_TTL_MS`;
  - existing code: `approvalState`, `loadProfile`, `resolveProfileRoot`, `readChannels`, `canPromote`, `suiteRunAt`, `ghRepoOf`, `ghJson`, `ringZeroRepo`, `ProcessRunner`, better-sqlite3.
- Produces:
  - `acks.ts`: `isAckKey(key)`, `readAcks(deps): Record<string, string>`, and `writeAck(deps, key, now)`, which writes atomically, 0600, and prunes acks older than 30 days.
  - `decisions.ts`:
    - `Decision { kind: "proposal-won" | "profile-approval" | "proposals-staged" | "channel-promote"; id; title; since; command }`;
    - `readDecisions(deps, db, scrubber): Decision[]`;
    - `Health { doctor: JobView | null; judge: { status: "ok" | "degraded" | "missing"; failures24h: number | null; at: string } | null }`;
    - `readHealth(deps, run, jobs): Promise<Health>`, whose `judge health` result is cached 5 min in `fleet/judge-cache.json`.
  - `gh.ts`: `prsFor(deps, run, repos, scrubber): Promise<{ prs: PrView[]; errors: string[]; cached: boolean }>`. It makes one `gh api user` call and one `gh pr list --repo <origin slug>` per repo, cached 2 min in `fleet/gh-cache.json`; a cache stamped in the future is refetched. Only `https://github.com/` URLs are kept.
  - `bridge.ts`: `bridgeDbPath(deps, loaded): string | null` (`AW_BRIDGE_DB`, else `<toolkit repo>/mcp-bridge/bridge.db`) and `unreadFor(file, recipient): { unread; since } | null`, which opens the file query-only and never marks a message read.
  - `needs.ts`:
    - `NeedKind`, `NeedAction` (`attach | terminal | run(fleet.ack) | reject | open`) and `NeedItem { key; kind; state; title; reason; repo; since; link; action; secondary?; urgent; ackable }`;
    - `NeedInputs`, `needsYou(inputs): NeedItem[]` (spec §4.4, ordered as in spec decision 16), and `doneUnread(session, acks)`.
    - Keys: `session:<p>:<id>`, `failure:<p>:<id>:<state>:<turn start>`, `job:<kind>:<job id>`, `index-stale:<repo>:<built at|never>`, `judge:<date>`, `proposal-won:<id>`, `profile-approval:<hash12>`, `proposals-staged:<count>`, `channel-promote:<sha12>`, `pr:<repo>#<n>`, `bridge:<recipient>`.

Traces for the first `needsYou` test:
- **Sessions:** approval (rank 0) comes before input (1) and plan ready (2). The working session isn't listed.
- **The won decision:** one item, with the terminal command first and reject second.
- **Failures:** they sort by state rank, then by `since`:
  1. stuck (rank 7);
  2. the two `failed` jobs (rank 9). The index build and doctor share `since` (both `endedAt` = `at(400)`), so the stable sort keeps insertion order: the index build, then doctor;
  3. stale, attn and degraded, which aren't spec states (rank 13), ordered by `since`: the never-built index (1970), the weekly job (`at(400)`), then the judge (now).
- **PR, then bridge.**

`recipient` in the bridge command is the profile's `user`, which the schema limits to `[a-z0-9-]`, so it's safe inside the quoted URL.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-needs.test.ts tests/fleet-decisions.test.ts tests/fleet-gh.test.ts tests/fleet-bridge.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet sindri/src/evolve/cmd/channel.ts sindri/tests
git commit -m "feat: sindri fleet needs-you aggregator with decisions, gh PRs, bridge unread and acks" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 8: The `sindri fleet` command and the collector

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/place.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/usage.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/today.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/sentences.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/collect.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/render.ts`, `sindri/src/fleet/command.ts`
- Modify:
  - `sindri/src/fleet/proc-real.ts` (add `realFleetIo()`);
  - `sindri/src/main.ts` (register `fleet`);
  - `sindri/src/errors.ts` (`SND-FLEET-001`, `-002`, `-003`).
- Generated: `docs/sindri/errors.md` (`npm run gen`)
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-collect.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-usage.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/fleet-command.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything from Tasks 1–7; `openLedgerReadOnly`, `ledgerPath`, `stateDir`, `approvedProfile`, `FleetSchema`, `makeScrubber`, `compileExtraPatterns`, `readChannels`, `parseFlags`, `success`, `fromError`, `SindriError`, `realProcessRunner`, `GitRunner`.
- Produces:
  - Error codes:
    - `SND-FLEET-001` "A fleet source could not be read; the other sources still show.";
    - `SND-FLEET-002` "A fleet source ran past its time or size budget, so it shows only its newest sessions.";
    - `SND-FLEET-003` "Nothing that can be acknowledged has that key."
  - `place.ts`: `placeSessions(git, sessions, loaded)`. One `git rev-parse --show-toplevel --git-common-dir` per distinct cwd (at most 300) fills `repo` (the profile name) and `worktree` (the git top-level when it isn't the repo's main checkout, or the top-level for repos outside the profile).
  - `usage.ts`: `scorerBin(deps)` and `usageFor(deps, run, sessions): Promise<Map<id, tokens>>` (spec decision 6: cached 60 s in `fleet/usage-cache.json`, at most 20 refreshes per pass, oldest first).
  - `today.ts`: `TodayView` and `todayOf(sessions, now, budgetPerDay, sources, health)`.
  - `sentences.ts`: `EMPTY`, the empty-state sentences that the CLI and the UI share word for word (spec §5 "Empty").
  - `collect.ts`:
    - `FleetSession = StatedSession & { doneUnread; turnAgeMs }`;
    - `SourceStatus { name; on; ok; ms; count; truncated; error: { code; message } | null }`;
    - `Pipeline { proposals: Record<status, count>; channel: { stable: string | null; next: { sha; installedAt; soakedDays } | null } }`;
    - `FleetReport` (`v: 1`), holding `generatedAt`, `profile`, `counts`, `needs`, `sessions`, `jobs`, `history`, `heavyLock`, `repos`, `scopeRuns`, `decisions`, `pipeline`, `health`, `sources` and `today`;
    - `runSource(io, name, on, fn, scrubber)`;
    - `collectFleet(deps, io): Promise<FleetReport>`, which never throws for a source's sake.
  - `render.ts`: `renderFleet(report): string` (state words first, no colour, ending in a `Next:` line).
  - `command.ts`: `makeFleetCommand(io): Command`, covering:
    - `sindri fleet [--provider P] [--state S] [--json]` (exit 1 when needs isn't empty; `--state plan-ready` is accepted for `plan ready`);
    - `sindri fleet ack <key> [--json]`;
    - `sindri fleet hook <provider>`, which prints nothing and always exits 0.
  - `proc-real.ts`: `realFleetIo(): FleetIo`, with the v1 `CodexStatusProbe` returning `null`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-usage.test.ts tests/fleet-collect.test.ts tests/fleet-command.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../src/fleet/usage.js` (and likewise for `collect.js`, `command.js`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`sindri/src/errors.ts`: add after the `SND-EVOLVE-*` block:

```ts
  "SND-FLEET-001": { summary: "A fleet source could not be read; the other sources still show.", fix: "sindri fleet --json shows the source's error under sources; sindri doctor checks the paths" },
  "SND-FLEET-002": { summary: "A fleet source ran past its time or size budget, so it shows only its newest sessions.", fix: "close or archive old sessions, or turn the source off with fleet.sources.<name>: false, then sindri profile approve" },
  "SND-FLEET-003": { summary: "Nothing that can be acknowledged has that key.", fix: "sindri fleet --json lists the current keys (needs[].key where ackable is true, or done:<provider>:<id>)" },
```

Then `cd sindri && npm run gen` (rewrites `docs/sindri/errors.md`).

In the placement test, `/nonexistent/place` doesn't exist, so it gets no git call, `repo: null` and `worktree: null`. The main checkout's top-level equals the repo path, so `worktree: null`. The linked worktree's common dir is `<repo>/.git`, so its repo is the profile repo and its worktree is the worktree's path.

Traces:
- **The first collect test:** the claude session's spool permission has no newer output, so it is `approval`; the waiting row comes first. Codex: no holder, so it's dead with a completed turn: `ended`. Cursor has no live agent and no transcript, so its turn is closed and it's `ended`. There's no profile, so `gh` and `bridge` are `on: false` (gh needs repos, bridge needs a profile). Today counts three agents and one prompt.
- **The 900-transcript test:** each `monotonic()` call adds 15 ms. The Claude source checks `overBudget` once per transcript, so it stops after about 130 transcripts (2000 / 15); it is `truncated` with `SND-FLEET-002`, and the newest transcript (`t0`) comes first.

Trace for the first command test: the needs line reads `approval  claude  -  Fix the login form  waiting 0 s  the session says it is waiting on you`. `n.link.split("/")[2]` takes the provider out of `/agent/claude/<id>`. With no profile, the repo column is `-`. A waiting row's `since` is the spool's pending time or the session's `updatedAt`; here that's the transcript's mtime, which the fixture sets to `NOW`, so the age is `0 s`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-usage.test.ts tests/fleet-collect.test.ts tests/fleet-command.test.ts tests/errors.test.ts tests/main.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%. Then a manual read-only smoke run against this machine: `npm run build && node dist/cli.js fleet; echo "exit $?"`. Expected: the NEEDS YOU or "Nothing needs you." line, your live sessions under AGENTS, and exit 1 or 0 to match. Paste nothing from that output into commits or the plan.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri fleet command and collector" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 9: Dashboard server security, the read map and the action allowlist (`sindri dashboard`)

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/dashboard/tokens.ts`, `sindri/src/dashboard/security.ts`, `sindri/src/dashboard/actions.ts`, `sindri/src/dashboard/server.ts`, `sindri/src/dashboard/command.ts`, `sindri/src/dashboard/io-real.ts`
- Modify: `sindri/src/main.ts` (register `dashboard`), `sindri/src/errors.ts` (`SND-DASH-001`–`004`), `sindri/vitest.config.ts` (exclude `src/dashboard/io-real.ts`)
- Generated: `docs/sindri/errors.md`
- Test: `sindri/tests/dashboard-fixtures.ts` (shared), `sindri/tests/dashboard-tokens.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/dashboard-server.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/dashboard-command.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isAckKey` (Task 7); `dashboardDir`, `sameStart` (Tasks 1–2); `stripInvisible` (`evolve/invisible.ts`); `DashboardSchema`, `approvedProfile`, `openLedgerReadOnly`, `ProcessRunner`, `SindriError`, `parseFlags`, `success`, `fromError`.
- Produces:
  - Error codes:
    - `SND-DASH-001` "The dashboard port is already in use." (fix: set `dashboard.port` or pass `--port N`);
    - `SND-DASH-002` "The dashboard isn't running." (fix: `sindri dashboard`);
    - `SND-DASH-003` "The dashboard refused the request: no valid session, or a wrong Host, Origin or CSRF token." (fix: run `sindri dashboard --url`);
    - `SND-DASH-004` "That action can't run from the dashboard." (fix: copy the command and run it at a terminal).
  - `tokens.ts`:
    - `TOKEN_TTL_MS` (10 min), `COOKIE` (`sindri_session`), `mintToken(key, now, nonce?)`, `cookieHeader(id)`, `parseCookie(header)`;
    - `class TokenStore { exchange(token): Session | null; session(cookieHeader): Session | null }`. A token is used once and within 10 minutes, its HMAC is checked in constant time, and at most 50 sessions are kept.
  - `security.ts`: `CSP`, `securityHeaders()`, `hostOk(host, port)` and `originOk(origin, host, port)`.
  - `actions.ts`:
    - `READS` (`fleet` 4 s, `evolve` 30 s, `index` 60 s, `doctor` 300 s, `channel` 60 s, `scope` 60 s, each with its argv and its CLI hint) and `ReadName`;
    - `SAFE_ACTIONS` (`fleet.ack` with 1 checked argument; `evolve.reject` with an id and a reason of 3–200 visible characters);
    - `TERMINAL_ONLY` (`evolve.adopt`, `evolve.publish`, `channel.promote`, `profile.approve`);
    - `checkAction(action, args): { kind: "run"; argv } | { kind: "terminal"; command } | { kind: "refused"; why }`.
  - `server.ts`:
    - `SindriRunner`, `AttachHandler` (filled by Task 11), `DashboardOptions`, `PAGE` (the deep-link pattern);
    - `createDashboardHandler(o): http.RequestListener`;
    - `listenLoopback(handler, port): Promise<{ port; close() }>`, which binds `127.0.0.1` only. `EADDRINUSE` becomes `SND-DASH-001`, naming the port and `dashboard.port`.
    - Routes:
      - `GET /` and the deep links (`/needs`, `/agents`, `/repos`, `/auto`, `/today`, `/agent/<provider>/<id>`, `/repo/<name>`, `/job/<id>`): with `?t=` they exchange the token for a cookie and answer 303 to the same path; without a valid cookie they serve the 401 page;
      - `GET /static/<fixed file>`;
      - `GET /api/session` returns `{ csrf, notify, pollMs, overSsh }`;
      - `GET /api/read/<name>`;
      - `POST /api/action` needs `Origin`, `X-Sindri-CSRF` and a JSON body of at most 8 KiB.
  - `command.ts`:
    - `DashboardIo { run; listen; untilStopped; randomKey; node; cliPath; uiDir; jsDir; monotonic }`;
    - `serverFile(deps)` (`$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/server.json`, 0600) and `liveServer(deps)`;
    - `makeDashboardCommand(io): Command` for `sindri dashboard [--port N] | --url | --open <path>` (`--json` on each).
  - `io-real.ts`: `realDashboardIo()`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/dashboard-tokens.test.ts tests/dashboard-server.test.ts tests/dashboard-command.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../src/dashboard/tokens.js` (and likewise for `server.js` and `command.js`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

  "SND-DASH-003": { summary: "The dashboard refused the request: no valid session, or a wrong Host, Origin or CSRF token.", fix: "run `sindri dashboard --url` and open the printed URL" },
  "SND-DASH-004": { summary: "That action can't run from the dashboard.", fix: "commands that need a typed confirmation run only at a terminal: copy the command the dashboard shows" },

In `sindri/vitest.config.ts`, add `"src/dashboard/io-real.ts"` to `coverage.exclude`, with the comment `// signal wait and real paths; exercised end to end (Task 13)`.

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/dashboard-tokens.test.ts tests/dashboard-server.test.ts tests/dashboard-command.test.ts tests/errors.test.ts tests/main.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

git add sindri/src sindri/tests sindri/vitest.config.ts docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri dashboard server: loopback bind, one-time tokens, Host/Origin/CSRF checks, CSP, fixed actions" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 10: The dashboard UI: five views, deep links, polling, the states, and the attention signal

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/ui/index.html`, `sindri/ui/app.css`, `sindri/ui/favicon.svg`, `sindri/ui/favicon-attn.svg`, `sindri/ui/tsconfig.json`, `sindri/ui/src/model.ts`, `sindri/ui/src/app.ts`
- Modify:
  - `sindri/package.json`: `build` also compiles the UI; `typecheck` also checks it; add the `playwright` devDependency;
  - `sindri/vitest.config.ts`: coverage includes `ui/src/model.ts`;
  - `sindri/tsconfig.test.json`: include `ui/src/model.ts`.
- Test: `sindri/tests/ui-model.test.ts`, `sindri/tests/browser/fixture.ts`, `sindri/tests/browser/dashboard.browser.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the HTTP surface from Task 9 (`/api/session`, `/api/read/<name>`, `POST /api/action`, `POST /api/attach`); the `FleetReport` JSON from Task 8; `EMPTY` (Task 8), which the tests compare with the UI's copy; `createDashboardHandler`, `listenLoopback`, `mintToken` (Task 9) for the browser tests.
- Produces:
  - `ui/src/model.ts` (pure, no DOM, 100% covered):
    - `EMPTY`, `ATTN` (the attention colours and their backgrounds), `PIPELINE`;
    - `route(pathname): Route`, `landing(needCount)`, `tabTitle(n)`, `announcement(prev, next)`;
    - `visible(s, keepNewlines?)`, which shows every control or invisible character as `\u{XXXX}`;
    - `age(ms)`, `staleText(lastOk, now, failures)`;
    - `marks(needs, seen): Map<key, "pulse" | "attn" | "calm">`, `arrivals(prevKeys, needs)`, `toNotify(needs, notified, enabled)`;
    - `filterSessions(sessions, filters)`, `groupSessions(sessions)`, `contrast(a, b)`.
  - `ui/src/app.ts`: the DOM glue. It renders with `textContent` only and polls with one `setTimeout` chain. Every list is a keyed sync that never re-creates a row, never moves the row that holds focus, and never calls `focus()` or scrolls during a poll.
  - Behaviour (spec §5 and §5.1):
    - **Landing:** opens on Needs you when it isn't empty, otherwise on Agents. Deep links: `/agent/<p>/<id>` (that row expanded, plus a `done:` ack when it carries the done marker), `/repo/<name>` and `/job/<id>`.
    - **States:** loading skeletons on the first load only; empty sentences; an error banner (code, message and the CLI command); "updated Ns ago"; after 3 failed polls, "sindri not responding: run `sindri doctor`"; on a 401, one session-ended banner, and polling stops.
    - **Attention:** a new row slides in. `approval` and `input` rows pulse, with the nav item and the header band, until the row has been 50% visible for 1 s in a focused tab, or is focused, clicked or acted on. `failed` and `limited` rows show the colour with no motion. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, a static 3 px outline replaces the motion.
    - **Announcements and signals:** one polite `aria-live` region, the tab title `(N) Needs you · Sindri`, a favicon that blinks once to its attention version, and an OS notification for `approval` and `input` only, once per item, when `dashboard.notify` is on and the builder granted permission.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`sindri/tests/ui-model.test.ts`:

describe("routes and landing", () => {
  it("maps every deep link and view path, and lets / fall to the landing rule", () => {

The restart half routes the fleet read to a 401 instead of restarting on the same port, because Playwright keeps the page's origin. What it proves is the client's behaviour on a 401. That the server answers 401 after a restart is pinned in Task 9 (`refuses … a token or cookie from before a restart`).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd sindri && npm install --save-dev playwright@^1.48.0 && npx playwright install chromium`. This is the one new dependency; skip the install if `node_modules/playwright` is already there. `npx playwright install chromium` is a no-op when the browser is cached.
Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/ui-model.test.ts tests/browser/dashboard.browser.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../ui/src/model.js` and, for the browser file, `error TS5058: The specified path does not exist: '…/ui/tsconfig.json'` from `compileUi`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`sindri/ui/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "../dist/ui",
    "declaration": false,
    "sourceMap": false
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

Notes for the implementer:
- `Read<T>` mirrors Task 9's `ReadResult`.
- `PIPELINE.filter(...).join(" → ") || "none"` falls back to "none" when the pipeline is empty.
- `fillSession` returns `void` in both branches; `text()` returns void.
- The browser fixture's `report()` passes `signals: {}` because the UI never reads `signals`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/ui-model.test.ts tests/browser/dashboard.browser.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (the browser file runs about 20 s in real headless Chromium).
Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS; coverage 100%, now including `ui/src/model.ts`.
Then `npm run build && ls dist/ui`. Expected: `app.js  model.js`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/ui sindri/tests sindri/package.json sindri/package-lock.json sindri/vitest.config.ts sindri/tsconfig.test.json
git commit -m "feat: sindri dashboard UI with five views, deep links and the needs-you attention signal" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 11: Attach: resolver and launcher, never resuming a live session

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/dashboard/attach.ts`
- Modify:
  - `sindri/src/dashboard/command.ts` (the attach factory gets the CLI runner);
  - `sindri/src/main.ts` (pass the real attach factory);
  - `sindri/src/errors.ts` (`SND-DASH-005`).
- Generated: `docs/sindri/errors.md`
- Test: `sindri/tests/dashboard-attach.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `FleetReport`, `FleetSession` (Task 8); `isUnder` (Task 1); `isProvider`, `HOSTS` (Task 1); `SindriRunner`, `AttachHandler`, `createDashboardHandler`'s `POST /api/attach` (Task 9); `ProcessRunner`.
- Produces:
  - Error code `SND-DASH-005` "Sindri couldn't safely work out how to attach to that session." (fix: run the command the dashboard shows yourself, in a terminal).
  - Types: `AttachTarget` (the slice of a session attach needs), `LaunchStep = { argv } | { warp: { cwd; command } }`, and `AttachPlan = { kind: "focus" | "resume"; steps; label } | { kind: "copy"; command; why; candidates }`.
  - `AttachEnv { overSsh; platform; roots; exists; apps; onPath }`.
  - `resolveAttach(target, env): AttachPlan`, following spec §7's table:
    - **Liveness:** alive means focus the host; ended, crashed or interrupted means resume. A live session is never resumed, and `assertSafe` throws if a plan would.
    - **Checks:** ids must match the provider's format; paths must exist inside a known repo or worktree.
    - **When unsure** (the host is uncertain, the app or path is missing, or the dashboard runs over ssh), it gives the candidates and a copyable command.
  - `assertSafe(target, plan)`, `warpYaml(cwd, command)`.
  - `Launcher { run(argv): Promise<number>; writeWarpConfig(yaml): string }` and `launch(plan, launcher, fallback)`. The only commands it runs are `open -a <app> [path]`, `open warp://launch/sindri-attach.yaml`, `cursor <path>` and `tmux`, the last only inside a Warp launch config.
  - `realLauncher(deps, run)` (the Warp config goes to `~/.warp/launch_configurations/sindri-attach.yaml`, 0600), `onPath(deps, bin)`, `appExists(deps, name)`.
  - `makeAttachHandler(deps, run, overSsh, launcher, apps?, exists?): AttachHandler`. It re-reads `sindri fleet --json` before every attach, so it never acts on a stale poll, and it calls `assertSafe` before launching.

In the first handler test, the `apps` probe is passed as `() => true`, so the result doesn't depend on whether `/Applications/Warp.app` exists on the test machine. The fixture's `tempDir()` path exists, and the report's repo path equals it, so `pathOk` holds. `main.ts` passes `realLauncher(deps, realProcessRunner())` and the default probes.

`sindri/src/dashboard/command.ts`: change the factory parameter to `attach: (deps: Deps, run: SindriRunner) => AttachHandler | null = () => null`. Hoist the runner above `createDashboardHandler`:

```ts
      const run: SindriRunner = (a) => io.run.run([io.node, io.cliPath, ...a], { cwd: deps.home, timeoutMs: 30_000 });
```

Then pass `run` and `attach: attach(deps, run)` to it. Import `type SindriRunner` from `./server.js`.

`sindri/src/main.ts`: pass the real attach factory:

```ts
    run: (args, deps) => makeDashboardCommand(realDashboardIo(), (d, run) => makeAttachHandler(d, run, d.env.SSH_CONNECTION !== undefined, realLauncher(d, realProcessRunner())))(args, deps),
```

(Import `makeAttachHandler` and `realLauncher` from `./dashboard/attach.js`; `realProcessRunner` is already imported.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/dashboard-attach.test.ts tests/dashboard-server.test.ts tests/dashboard-command.test.ts tests/errors.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. Then, once for the task: `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src sindri/tests docs/sindri/errors.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri dashboard attach: focus live sessions, resume only ended ones" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 12: The SwiftBar badge and its installer step (`sindri fleet --badge`)

**Files:**
- Create: `sindri/src/fleet/badge.ts`, `config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh` (executable), `scripts/tests/swiftbar-plugin.test.sh`
- Modify:
  - `sindri/src/fleet/command.ts` (`--badge`);
  - `scripts/install-sindri.sh` (install the plugin when SwiftBar is present);
  - `scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`;
  - `AGENTS.md` (the bash test line).
- Test: `sindri/tests/fleet-badge.test.ts`, the bash tests above

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `FleetReport` (Task 8), `liveServer` (Task 9), `ATTN.light` (the same colour as the UI, `#c2410c`).
- Produces:
  - `renderBadge(report, sindriBin, dashboardUp): string` in SwiftBar's format (spec §5.2 and main spec §10.5):
    - the title is `N working · M needs you` in the attention colour, or `N working`, or `sindri idle`;
    - the dropdown lists up to 20 needs-you items. While the dashboard runs, each item opens `sindri dashboard --open <deep link>`; otherwise the dropdown says how to start it;
    - no action runs from the menu bar. `|` and newlines are stripped from item text.
  - `sindri fleet --badge` prints that and always exits 0.
  - `config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh` refreshes every 30 s (SwiftBar reads the interval from the file name). It kills a `sindri fleet` that runs past 10 s (`AW_SWIFTBAR_BUDGET_TICKS`, in 0.1 s ticks, default 100) and shows `sindri ? (stale)` when it fails or is slow.
  - `install-sindri.sh` writes the plugin into SwiftBar's plugin folder (`AW_SWIFTBAR_DIR`, else `defaults read com.ameba.SwiftBar PluginDirectory`) with `__BIN__` filled in. `AW_NO_SWIFTBAR=1` skips it. Without SwiftBar it prints that it skipped the step.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`sindri/tests/fleet-badge.test.ts`:

Add to `scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`. Beside `export AW_NO_FLEET_HOOK=1`, add `export AW_NO_SWIFTBAR=1`. Then add this test, and call it at the bottom:

```bash

  grep -q "SwiftBar not found" <<<"$out" || { echo "FAIL: missing SwiftBar not reported: $out"; exit 1; }
  echo "PASS: test_swiftbar_plugin"
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-badge.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `Failed to load url ../src/fleet/badge.js`.
Run: `bash scripts/tests/swiftbar-plugin.test.sh`
Expected: FAIL (`…/config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh: No such file or directory`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`sindri/src/fleet/badge.ts`:

```ts
import type { FleetReport } from "./collect.js";
import { EMPTY } from "./sentences.js";

const ATTN = "#c2410c"; // ui/src/model.ts ATTN.light
const MAX_ITEMS = 20;
// SwiftBar splits a line at "|" into text and parameters; newlines would start new items.
const clean = (s: string): string => s.replace(/[|\r\n]+/g, " ").replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim().slice(0, 80);

// Spec §5.2: "3 working · 1 needs you", the needs-you items in the dropdown, a click opens the dashboard at
// that item. No action runs from the menu bar.
export function renderBadge(r: FleetReport, sindriBin: string, dashboardUp: boolean): string {
  const n = r.needs.length;
  const w = r.counts.working;
  const open = (p: string): string => (dashboardUp ? ` | bash="${sindriBin.replace(/"/g, "")}" param1=dashboard param2=--open param3=${p} terminal=false` : "");
  const lines = [n > 0 ? `${w} working · ${n} needs you | color=${ATTN}` : r.counts.live > 0 ? `${w} working` : "sindri idle", "---"];
  if (n === 0) lines.push(EMPTY.needs(w, r.counts.live));
  else {
    lines.push("Needs you");
    for (const it of r.needs.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS)) lines.push(`${clean(`${it.state}: ${it.title}`)}${open(it.link)}`);
    if (n > MAX_ITEMS) lines.push(`… and ${n - MAX_ITEMS} more${open("/needs")}`);
  }
  lines.push("---", dashboardUp ? `Open the dashboard${open("/")}` : "The dashboard isn't running: start it in a terminal with sindri dashboard");
  return lines.join("\n");
}
```

`sindri/src/fleet/command.ts`: in `list`, add `badge: { type: "boolean" }` to the flags. After collecting:

```ts
  if (values.badge === true) return success(renderBadge(report, deps.env.SINDRI_BIN ?? "sindri", liveServer(deps) !== null), report, false, 0);
```

(Import `renderBadge` from `./badge.js` and `liveServer` from `../dashboard/command.js`. Add `[--badge]` to the `fleet` usage line in `main.ts`: `sindri fleet [--provider claude|codex|cursor] [--state S] [--json|--badge]`.)

`config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh` (mode 755):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# <xbar.title>Sindri fleet</xbar.title>
# <xbar.desc>Agents working and what needs you, from sindri fleet --badge. Read-only: a click opens the dashboard.</xbar.desc>
# <swiftbar.hideRunInTerminal>true</swiftbar.hideRunInTerminal>
# Installed by scripts/install-sindri.sh, which fills in __BIN__. Refreshes every 30 s (the name says so).
SINDRI="${AW_SINDRI_BIN:-__BIN__/sindri}"
[ -x "$SINDRI" ] || SINDRI="$(command -v sindri 2>/dev/null || true)"
if [ -z "$SINDRI" ] || [ ! -x "$SINDRI" ]; then
  printf 'sindri ?\n---\nsindri is not installed: scripts/install-sindri.sh\n'
  exit 0
fi
TICKS="${AW_SWIFTBAR_BUDGET_TICKS:-100}"
case "$TICKS" in ''|*[!0-9]*) TICKS=100 ;; esac
OUT="$(mktemp 2>/dev/null)" || { printf 'sindri ?\n'; exit 0; }
trap 'unlink "$OUT" 2>/dev/null' EXIT
( SINDRI_BIN="$SINDRI" "$SINDRI" fleet --badge > "$OUT" 2>/dev/null ) < /dev/null &
PID=$!
while kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null; do
  if [ "$TICKS" -le 0 ]; then
    pkill -P "$PID" 2>/dev/null
    kill -9 "$PID" 2>/dev/null
    printf 'sindri ? (stale)\n---\nsindri fleet took over 10 s: run sindri doctor\n'
    exit 0
  fi
  TICKS=$((TICKS - 1))
  sleep 0.1
done
if ! wait "$PID" || [ ! -s "$OUT" ]; then
  printf 'sindri ? (stale)\n---\nsindri not responding: run sindri doctor\n'
  exit 0
fi
cat "$OUT"
exit 0
```

`scripts/install-sindri.sh`: add after `install_fleet_hook`:

```bash
# The menu-bar badge (spec §5.2): only when SwiftBar is installed. AW_SWIFTBAR_DIR overrides the lookup.
swiftbar_dir() {
  if [ -n "${AW_SWIFTBAR_DIR:-}" ]; then echo "$AW_SWIFTBAR_DIR"; return; fi
  [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ] || return 0
  defaults read com.ameba.SwiftBar PluginDirectory 2>/dev/null || true
}

install_swiftbar_plugin() {
  [ "${AW_NO_SWIFTBAR:-0}" = "1" ] && return 0
  local dir
  dir="$(swiftbar_dir)"
  if [ -z "$dir" ] || [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
    echo "  sindri: SwiftBar not found; skipped the menu-bar badge (install SwiftBar, then rerun this script)"
    return 0
  fi
  if [ "${AW_DRY_RUN:-0}" = "1" ]; then
    echo "  [dry-run] would install the SwiftBar plugin into $dir"
    return 0
  fi
  sed -e "s|__BIN__|$BIN_DIR|g" "$SCRIPT_DIR/config/swiftbar/sindri-fleet.30s.sh" > "$dir/sindri-fleet.30s.sh"
  chmod 755 "$dir/sindri-fleet.30s.sh"
  echo "  sindri: menu-bar badge installed ($dir/sindri-fleet.30s.sh)"
}
```

Call `install_swiftbar_plugin` in the plain-install dry-run branch (before its `exit 0`) and in the real branch after the fleet hooks.

`AGENTS.md`: add `bash scripts/tests/swiftbar-plugin.test.sh` after `bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cd sindri && npx vitest run tests/fleet-badge.test.ts tests/fleet-command.test.ts`, then from the repo root `bash scripts/tests/swiftbar-plugin.test.sh && bash scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh`.
Expected: all PASS. Then, once for the task: `cd sindri && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`. Expected: all PASS, coverage 100%.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add sindri/src/fleet sindri/src/main.ts sindri/tests config/swiftbar scripts/install-sindri.sh scripts/tests AGENTS.md
git commit -m "feat: sindri menu-bar badge (SwiftBar) and fleet --badge" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 13: Docs, the end-to-end evidence run, and the merge gate

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/sindri/dashboard.md`, `sindri/scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs`
- Modify:
  - `docs/sindri/README.md` (command rows, "Where things live");
  - `AGENTS.md` (Commands; the `sindri/` and `config/` directory comments);
  - `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the Sindri section);
  - `.agents/rules/testing.md` (the sindri row: new coverage excludes and the browser tests);
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-sindri-dashboard-design.md` (a closing "Decisions made in the plan" section).
- Test: the full merge gate; the end-to-end run against this machine's real sessions, with screenshots inspected.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.
- Produces:
  - Docs that match the shipped behaviour.
  - `sindri/scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs <url> <out-dir>`: a Playwright script, not part of `npm test`, that saves screenshots of every view in light, dark and reduced-motion modes.
  - The evidence checklist recorded in the PR body (text only, no images).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the docs**

`docs/sindri/dashboard.md`:

````markdown
# Sindri dashboard and fleet

One place to see every agent on this machine (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor), what sindri is doing on its own, and what needs you. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-sindri-dashboard-design.md`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sindri fleet [--provider P] [--state S] [--json\|--badge]` | Every session with one state each, sindri's jobs, the heavy-job lock, and the needs-you list. Exit 1 when something needs you |
| `sindri fleet ack <key>` | Hide a failure until it happens again; `done:<provider>:<id>` marks a finished turn seen |
| `sindri fleet hook <provider>` | The `aw:fleet` hook's entry point (stdin: the hook payload; prints nothing; always exits 0) |
| `sindri dashboard [--port N]` | Serve the dashboard on 127.0.0.1 until Ctrl-C; logs a one-time URL |
| `sindri dashboard --url` | A fresh one-time URL for the running dashboard |
| `sindri dashboard --open <path>` | Open a deep link (`/needs`, `/agent/claude/<id>`, `/repo/<name>`, `/job/<id>`) in the browser |

## States

Exactly one per session, always in words, highest priority first: `approval`, `input`, `plan ready`, `auth`, `working`, `background`, `ready`, `stuck`, `interrupted`, `failed`, `limited`, `crashed`, `ended`. Rows marked `estimated` were guessed from transcript activity, which is every Cursor session and any Codex session without hook events. Subagents sit under their parent. A child waiting on you raises the parent's state.

## The needs-you signal

The attention colour (`#c2410c` light, `#fb923c` dark) is used for nothing else.
- **Pulsing:** `approval` and `input` rows pulse, with the "Needs you" tab and the header band, until you've seen the row: it has been half in view for a second while the tab has focus, or you focused, clicked or acted on it.
- **Colour, no motion:** `failed` and `limited` rows.
- **Reduced motion:** with reduced motion on, a static outline replaces the pulse.
- **Signals elsewhere:** the tab title reads `(N) Needs you · Sindri`, the favicon gets a dot, one polite screen-reader announcement says "2 now need you", and the menu bar shows the count. An OS notification fires for approvals and questions if `dashboard.notify` is on and you allowed notifications.

## Security

- **Binding:** it listens on `127.0.0.1:<dashboard.port>` only. A taken port is `SND-DASH-001`; it never picks another port.
- **Tokens:** `--url` mints a one-time token (10 minutes) that the first page load exchanges for an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie, then drops from the URL. A restart changes the key, so old links and cookies stop working: a 401 says "run `sindri dashboard --url`".
- **Request checks:** every request needs a `Host` of `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`, and every action also needs a matching `Origin` and the CSRF token. No CORS headers are ever sent.
- **Headers:** CSP `default-src 'self'`, with no inline script or style, nothing from another origin, and `frame-ancestors 'none'`; plus `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- **Actions:** the dashboard runs only `sindri fleet ack <key>` and `sindri evolve reject <id> --reason <text>`, with checked arguments and no shell. `evolve adopt`, `evolve publish`, `channel promote` and `profile approve` need a typed confirmation, so the dashboard only shows them as a command to copy.
- **Untrusted text:** agent-written text is scrubbed and escaped in the collector, and the page sets it as text only. Control and invisible characters show as `\u{XXXX}`.
- **Over ssh:** forward the same port on both ends, `ssh -L 7190:127.0.0.1:7190 <box>`, because the Host check needs it. Attach then shows the command to run instead of launching.

## Attach

Sindri never resumes a session that is still running: two processes writing one session corrupt it. Before every attach it reads the fleet again.

| Host | Alive | Ended, crashed or interrupted |
|---|---|---|
| T3 Code | Bring T3 to the front, naming the thread and worktree (T3 has no deep link) | Same; resume inside T3 |
| Warp or a terminal (Claude CLI) | Bring Warp to the front; the row names the tab's tty and title. In another terminal, sindri shows the candidates | A new Warp tab at the session's folder running `claude --resume <id>` (through `~/.warp/launch_configurations/sindri-attach.yaml`) |
| Codex | The Codex app, or Warp | `codex resume <id>` in a new Warp tab |
| Cursor | `cursor <folder>` (or `open -a Cursor <folder>`); a specific chat can't be opened | Same |
| tmux (sindri workers, later) | `tmux attach -t <session>` in a new Warp tab | Same |

Ids must match the provider's format, and folders must exist inside an onboarded repo or one of its worktrees. Otherwise you get the command to copy.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/spool/<provider>.jsonl` (+ `.1.jsonl`) | One line per hook event (0600); rotated at 1 MiB |
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/jobs/latest/*.json`, `history.jsonl` | The last run of each job, and recent runs |
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/acks.json` | Acknowledged failures and seen "done" markers (30 days) |
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/{gh,usage,judge}-cache.json` | Caches: gh PRs (2 min), `scorer live` tokens (60 s), `judge health` (5 min) |
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/locks/heavy-job.lock.queue/` | Who is waiting for the heavy-job lock (only waiters that use sindri) |
| `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/server.json` | The running dashboard: pid, port, the per-restart token key (0600) |

## Decisions and limits

- **Transcripts and turn outcomes.** Claude transcripts on disk have no SDK `result` record, so a turn's outcome comes from the interruption markers, the turn-end lines and the API-error lines in the transcript.
- **429 versus 529.** A 429 or a usage limit is `limited`; a 529 or any other API error is `failed`.
- **Codex.** An observer can't reach the app-server of a session it didn't start. Codex approvals come from the `PermissionRequest` hook and from approval events in the rollout.
- **Tokens and cost.** Tokens come from `scorer live` (live Claude sessions, cached 60 s) and from Codex's `token_count`. Dollars come from Claude's `cost-state` line. Figures are per session; Today sums the sessions active since local midnight.
- **Bridge.** Unread bridge messages are counted read-only in `mcp-bridge/bridge.db` (`AW_BRIDGE_DB` overrides the path). The REST endpoint marks messages as read, so the collector never calls it.
- **Bounds.** Each pass reads at most 1 MiB per transcript, 200 sessions per source and 2 s per source, and only files changed in the last 24 h unless the process is alive. A Codex session started more than 60 day-directories ago doesn't show.
- **Spool.** A pending permission or question clears on the next `Stop`, prompt, session end, compaction, or transcript output.
- **Menu bar.** The menu-bar badge opens deep links through `sindri dashboard --open`.

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Do |
|---|---|
| `SND-DASH-001 port 7190 is in use (dashboard.port)` | Another program has the port: set `dashboard.port` (then `sindri profile approve`) or pass `--port` |
| "No dashboard session in this tab" | The dashboard restarted: `sindri dashboard --url` |
| "sindri not responding: run `sindri doctor`" | The dashboard can't run `sindri fleet`; check `sindri doctor` |
| A source shows `SND-FLEET-001` | That provider's store couldn't be read; the message says why. The other sources still show |
| A source shows `SND-FLEET-002` | It hit the time or size budget: only its newest sessions show |
| Approvals don't show | Is the hook installed? `jq '.hooks.PermissionRequest' ~/.claude/settings.json` should list `# aw:fleet`. Reinstall: `scripts/install-sindri.sh --fleet-hook --provider claude` |
| Codex hooks don't run | Open `codex`, run `/hooks`, and trust the `aw:*` entries |
````

`docs/sindri/README.md`:
- Add two command rows: `sindri fleet [--provider P] [--state S] [--json|--badge]`, `fleet ack <key>`, `fleet hook <provider>`, described as "Every agent on this machine, one state each, and what needs you. See `dashboard.md`"; and `sindri dashboard [--port N] | --url | --open <path>`, described as "The local dashboard (127.0.0.1): five views, attach, the needs-you signal. See `dashboard.md`".
- Add to "Where things live" the rows for `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/` (spool, jobs, acks, caches) and `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/server.json`.
- Change the intro sentence "What exists today (Plans 2 and 3; …)" so it covers Plans 2–6.

`AGENTS.md`:
- Under Commands, after `sindri observe`, add:

```bash
sindri fleet [--json]                   # every agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor), sindri's jobs, what needs you
sindri dashboard                        # local dashboard on 127.0.0.1:7190 (sindri dashboard --url for a link)
```

- Change the `sindri/` tree comment to `# Sindri core: profile, ledger, lock, scrubber, plan-file tracker, observe, doctor, fleet collector, dashboard (CLI)`.
- Make the `config/` comment `… sindri-nudge SessionStart hook, aw:fleet spool hook, SwiftBar badge (+ hooks/adapters/ per provider)`.

`planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`, Sindri section: add this paragraph after the Plan 5 one:

```markdown
Plan 6 adds the fleet collector and the dashboard (`sindri/src/fleet/`, `sindri/src/dashboard/`, `sindri/ui/`; doc: `docs/sindri/dashboard.md`). `sindri fleet` reads, never writes, the provider stores: Claude Code's `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` (live only while the pid's start time matches `procStart`) and its transcripts and subagents; Codex rollouts (live while a process holds the file open); and Cursor's chat metadata (estimated). It reads only bounded tails, with a budget and an error entry per source. The `aw:fleet` hook, installed for every provider, appends one short scrubbed line per event to a spool, which is the authoritative "waiting on you" signal. Pure state rules give each session exactly one state; a needs-you aggregator adds sindri's decisions (won or staged proposals, a pending profile approval, a soaked channel build), failures (jobs recorded by `runCli`, stale indexes, doctor, judge health), gh PRs (cached) and unread bridge messages (counted read-only). `sindri dashboard` serves that on 127.0.0.1 only: one-time tokens become an HttpOnly SameSite=Strict cookie; Host, Origin and CSRF checks; CSP `default-src 'self'`; views are cached `sindri … --json` runs and actions a fixed argv list, and terminal-gated commands are shown, never run. Attach focuses a live session's host and resumes only ended ones. A SwiftBar plugin shows the counts in the menu bar.
```

`.agents/rules/testing.md`, the sindri row:
- Coverage excludes: add `src/fleet/proc-real.ts` (ps and lsof; smoke-tested in `tests/real.test.ts`), `src/dashboard/io-real.ts` (signal wait; exercised by the end-to-end run), and `ui/src/app.ts` (DOM glue; driven in real Chromium by `tests/browser/`, the ui-evidence precedent).
- Tests: add fleet fixtures (`tests/fleet-fixtures.ts`: real-shaped Claude, Codex and Cursor stores under a temp HOME) and dashboard fixtures (`tests/dashboard-fixtures.ts`: a real loopback server and raw `http.request` so tests set Host and Origin).

## 11. Decisions made in the implementation plan

The plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-sindri-plan-6-dashboard.md`, "Spec decisions in this plan") settled seventeen points the spec left open. Among them:
- turn outcomes come from transcript markers, because on-disk transcripts have no SDK result record;
- 429 means limited and 529 means failed;
- a Claude status of `waiting` means approval;
- the Codex app-server is behind a probe port, which returns nothing in v1;
- tokens come from `scorer live` and dollars from `cost-state`;
- bridge unread is counted read-only;
- six `fleet.sources` switches;
- a heavy-lock waiter queue and job records written by `runCli`;
- `sindri fleet ack` and `sindri dashboard --open`.

`docs/sindri/dashboard.md` restates each one.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the evidence script**

`sindri/scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs`:

```js
// Screenshots of every dashboard view for PR evidence (not part of npm test).
// Usage: node scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs <one-time-url> <out-dir>
// The URL comes from `sindri dashboard --url`; the screenshots show real session titles, so <out-dir> must be
// outside the repo (use $AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/evidence/plan-6/<run-id>/) and the files are never committed.
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import { chromium } from "playwright";

const [url, out] = process.argv.slice(2);
if (url === undefined || out === undefined) {
  console.error("usage: node scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs <one-time-url> <out-dir>");
  process.exit(2);
}
if (path.resolve(out).startsWith(path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "../.."))) {
  console.error("refusing: write evidence outside the repo");
  process.exit(2);
}
fs.mkdirSync(out, { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 });
const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
const modes = [{ name: "light", colorScheme: "light" }, { name: "dark", colorScheme: "dark" }, { name: "reduced", colorScheme: "light", reducedMotion: "reduce" }];
const origin = new URL(url).origin;
let first = true;
let cookies = [];
for (const m of modes) {
  const context = await browser.newContext({ colorScheme: m.colorScheme, reducedMotion: m.reducedMotion ?? "no-preference", viewport: { width: 1400, height: 900 } });
  const page = await context.newPage();
  // The token works once: the first context exchanges it, later contexts reuse that cookie.
  if (first) {
    await page.goto(url);
    first = false;
    cookies = await context.cookies();
  } else {
    await context.addCookies(cookies);
  }
  for (const view of ["needs", "agents", "repos", "auto", "today"]) {
    await page.goto(`${origin}/${view}`);
    await page.waitForTimeout(1500);
    await page.screenshot({ path: path.join(out, `${m.name}-${view}.png`), fullPage: true });
  }
  const title = await page.title();
  const href = await page.locator("#favicon").getAttribute("href");
  fs.appendFileSync(path.join(out, "facts.txt"), `${m.name}: title=${title} favicon=${href} url-has-token=${page.url().includes("?t=")}\n`);
  await context.close();
}
await browser.close();
console.log(`wrote ${modes.length * 5} screenshots and facts.txt to ${out}`);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the end-to-end check against this machine's real sessions**

Run each heavy command alone; wait for any heavy-lock holder first.
1. **Build:** `cd sindri && npm run build`. Expected: `dist/cli.js`, `dist/ui/app.js` and `dist/ui/model.js` exist.
2. **The hook:** if `jq -r '.hooks.PermissionRequest[]?.hooks[]?.command' ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -c 'aw:fleet'` prints `0`, install it with `scripts/install-sindri.sh --fleet-hook --provider claude` (the feature under test; it edits `~/.claude/settings.json` through `merge_hook`, touching only `# aw:fleet` entries).
3. **A known approval:** in a scratch folder (`mkdir -p /tmp/sindri-e2e && cd /tmp/sindri-e2e && claude`), ask the new session to run a shell command that needs permission, and leave the prompt waiting. Then run `node sindri/dist/cli.js fleet; echo "exit $?"`. Expected:
   - the scratch session listed under NEEDS YOU as `approval`, with the command in the reason;
   - exit 1;
   - a new line in `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/fleet/spool/claude.jsonl` whose `event` is `permission`.

   If the session shows as `working` and the spool has no line, the host reaped the hook's background process before it wrote. In that case change `fleet.sh` to run the CLI in the foreground under the same kill-after-budget loop as `sindri-nudge.sh` (`AW_FLEET_HOOK_BUDGET_MS`, default 1000), rerun Task 5's bash tests (the 30-hook burst must still finish within 2 s), then repeat this step.
4. **Serve:** `node sindri/dist/cli.js dashboard --port 7191 &` (wait for its `Dashboard:` line), then `URL="$(node sindri/dist/cli.js dashboard --url)"`.
5. **Screenshots:** `RUN="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"; node sindri/scripts/dashboard-evidence.mjs "$URL" "${AW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.agentic-workflow}/sindri/evidence/plan-6/$RUN"`. Expected: 15 PNGs and `facts.txt`.
6. **Inspect every screenshot yourself** (open each PNG). Compare with this list, and record PASS or FAIL per file in the PR body, as text only, with no images and no session titles:
   - `*-needs.png`: the scratch session's `approval` row is first, with the left bar in the attention colour (light: orange-red; dark: lighter orange). The state is written in words, and the Attach button is present. Nothing else uses that colour.
   - `reduced-needs.png`: the same row has a solid outline and no half-faded bar.
   - `*-agents.png`: the sessions are grouped by repo, then worktree. Every row shows provider, host, title, state, activity and turn age. No raw escape sequences or HTML markup are rendered as formatting.
   - `*-repos.png`: each onboarded repo shows index age, files, symbols and commits behind.
   - `*-auto.png`: jobs (at least `doctor` once the Today view has run it), the heavy-job lock line, and the proposal and channel lines.
   - `*-today.png`: cost and tokens, agents and turns, judge and doctor status.
   - `facts.txt`: every line has `title=(1) Needs you · Sindri` (or the real count), `favicon=/static/favicon-attn.svg` and `url-has-token=false`.
   - Forbidden in any screenshot: a token in the address, a "No dashboard session" banner, an error banner other than an expected `SND-FLEET-00x` source note, and text that is cut off and overlapping.

   A screenshot that is stale, from the wrong run, or visibly failing is a FAIL, whatever `facts.txt` says.
7. **Attach:** in the browser (`open "$(node sindri/dist/cli.js dashboard --url)"`):
   - click Attach on the waiting scratch session: its host comes to the front, and it is never resumed;
   - end the scratch session (Ctrl-D), wait one poll, and click Attach again: a new Warp tab opens in `/tmp/sindri-e2e` running `claude --resume <id>`. If Warp isn't installed, the dashboard shows the command instead.
8. **Stop:** stop the dashboard (`kill %1`). Expected: `Dashboard stopped.`, and `$AW_STATE_DIR/sindri/dashboard/server.json` is gone. The scratch folder may be removed by hand.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the merge gate (once, serially)**

```bash
for p in mcp-bridge scorer judge sindri skills/ui-evidence skills/bugFixOrchestrator; do (cd "$p" && npm run typecheck && npm test) || echo "FAILED: $p"; done
(cd sindri && npm run test:coverage)
for t in providers/tests/install.test.sh scripts/tests/sync-rules.test.sh scripts/tests/probe.test.sh scripts/tests/find-duplicate-skills.test.sh scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh scripts/tests/install-sindri.test.sh scripts/tests/swiftbar-plugin.test.sh config/hooks/tests/codex-adapter.test.sh config/hooks/tests/cursor-adapter.test.sh config/hooks/tests/provider-install-hooks.test.sh config/hooks/tests/probe-log.test.sh config/hooks/tests/judge-health.test.sh config/hooks/tests/sindri-nudge.test.sh config/hooks/tests/fleet-hook.test.sh; do bash "$t" || echo "FAILED: $t"; done
for t in config/lib/tests/*.test.sh; do bash "$t" || echo "FAILED: $t"; done
claude plugin validate mods/aw-live && claude plugin test mods/aw-live
scripts/sync-rules.sh --check
./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run
grep -rn "v8 ignore" sindri/src sindri/ui/src && echo "FAILED: v8 ignore" || true
grep -rnE ":\s*any\b|as any\b|<any>" sindri/src sindri/ui/src && echo "FAILED: any" || true
(cd sindri && node --input-type=module -e "import fs from 'node:fs'; import YAML from 'yaml'; const dir = process.env.AW_PROFILE_DIR ?? (process.env.AW_STATE_DIR ?? process.env.HOME + '/.agentic-workflow') + '/profile'; const p = YAML.parse(fs.readFileSync(dir + '/profile.yaml', 'utf8')); console.log((p.privacy?.denyTerms ?? []).join('\\n'));") > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sindri-deny-terms.txt"
[ -s "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sindri-deny-terms.txt" ] && grep -rnwiF -f "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sindri-deny-terms.txt" sindri/src sindri/ui sindri/tests sindri/scripts config scripts docs/sindri docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-sindri-plan-6-dashboard.md && echo "FAILED: a private term (privacy.denyTerms) is in the change" || true
```

Expected: no `FAILED:` line; coverage 100% (lines, functions, branches and statements); the dry run prints `aw:fleet` and SwiftBar lines and writes nothing. The private-term check reads the words from your own profile's `privacy.denyTerms`, so no workplace name is ever written into the repo or this plan; with an empty list it checks nothing, and you must then read the diff yourself for workplace names.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

## Done criteria for this plan

- **Fleet:** `sindri fleet` lists every live agent on the machine within one pass:
  - Claude Code, Codex and Cursor, including sessions Sindri didn't start;
  - each with exactly one state in words; approvals and questions come from the `aw:fleet` spool, and Cursor rows are labelled `estimated`;
  - exit 1 when something needs you.
- **Bounded and contained:** a missing or corrupt provider store, a recycled pid, a 50 MB or half-written transcript, 900 transcripts and a burst of 30 hooks are each handled as Review Focus 1–4 say, and each is pinned by a test.
- **Dashboard:**
  - `sindri dashboard` binds 127.0.0.1 only and refuses a taken port with `SND-DASH-001`;
  - tokens work once and change on restart, and Host, Origin and CSRF checks refuse everything else;
  - it sends the CSP and no CORS headers, runs only its fixed actions, and only shows terminal-gated commands.
- **The needs-you signal:** you can notice it without reading (colour, motion, tab title, favicon, menu-bar badge, optional OS notification), with the reduced-motion fallback and the polite announcements. Polling never moves focus, scroll position or input. A tab left open survives hundreds of polls and a restart (Review Focus 5).
- **Attach** never resumes a live session.
- **Evidence and merge:** the end-to-end run against real sessions has its screenshots inspected by the implementer, PASS for every file, recorded as text in the PR. The merge gate is green, with 100% coverage on the new sindri code.
