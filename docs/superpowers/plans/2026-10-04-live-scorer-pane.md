# Live scorer pane (Track D) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Show the scorer's numbers for the *current* session live inside Claude Code, the way Navigator's `/nav` pane does: context % of window, session cost and tokens, calls over 200k, this session's judge activity (calls, who decided, agreed/overrode/unsure, latency), which gates fired, queued wakes and context-guard fires. A `/live` pane plus a one-line band above the prompt, refreshed on turn end and on a timer, never blocking the session and failing silent.

**Architecture:** Two pieces. (1) `scorer live --session <id> [--json]`: a new scorer command that incrementally ingests only that session's transcripts (the existing `ingestFile` and its byte offsets, into a per-session database) and reads the judge database read-only, joined through `decision_details.session_id` (Plan A Task 1). Report and live share one definition of each figure: the same context-size SQL (`CTX`), the same 200k line, the same percentile, one `summarizeDecisions`. (2) `mods/aw-live`, a Claude Code *mod* (an in-process function-hook plugin documented by the `plugin-authoring` skill): `/live` toggles a pane, `/live status` prints the same numbers as text, and a band shows the headline. The mod shells out to `scorer live --json`; it holds the numbers in `$.state`; host-only facts (dollar cost, context percent, window) come from `$.session.usage()`.

**Tech Stack:** Scorer: Node ≥ 20, TypeScript 5.7 strict (ESM, Node16 resolution), Zod 3, better-sqlite3, Vitest 2 at 100% coverage. Mod: TypeScript/TSX against Claude Code's function-hooks API (`claude-code` types, early access), `claude plugin validate` and `claude plugin test`. Install: bash, `claude plugin marketplace/install`. Verified on `claude --version` = `2.1.289 (Claude Code)`.

**Spec:** `~/.agentic-workflow/digests/navigator-adoption.md` (Track D) and Navigator's mod, `hooks/mod/register.tsx` with `lib/`, `ui/` and `tests/` ($SCRATCH/navigator if still present). **Depends on** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-04-judge-calibration.md` (Plan A) **Task 1 only**: `decision_details.session_id`, `recordDecisionDetails`, `upsertEvalItem`, `eval_items` in `judge/src/db.ts`. Plan A Task 3 supplies `judge label import` / `judge label set` for the optional override hotkeys. Plan A Task 7 supplies the report's new columns (Task 8 here is gated on it). Plan B and C are independent of this plan.

## Where this fits, and the decisions behind it

**Claude only.** Mods are a Claude Code feature. Codex and Cursor keep exactly what they have today: the statusline segments (judge, rtk, headroom, prism) and the daily scorer report. `scripts/install-live-pane.sh --provider codex|cursor` prints that and writes nothing.

**Runtime: the mod shells out; it does not import the scorer.** A mod runs in "an environment of its own, with no DOM and no Node" (plugin-authoring reference). It reaches the machine only through `$`: `$.fs` (text and bytes), `$.process.run` (argv, no shell, 30 s default timeout; the mod sets 5 s), `$.http`. It cannot load `better-sqlite3` (a native module) or any Node library, and it cannot parse SQLite. So the numbers come from `$.process.run(["scorer","live",...])`, one short Node process per refresh. Measured on a prototype (2026-10-04, real 3-call transcript, warm): 76 ms wall, 277 ms cold. The 200 ms target is for warm calls; the first call of a long session pays the one-time ingest of the whole transcript, and the mod shows nothing until it returns.

**Which numbers come from where.**

| Number | Source | Why |
|---|---|---|
| session cost (USD) | `$.session.usage().cost.usd` | The scorer reads no prices; the host's `/cost` ledger is the truth. No price table is duplicated. |
| context % and window | `$.session.usage().context` | The window is per model (a prototype saw `window: 1000000` for the default model and `200000` for haiku). The mod passes the window to `scorer live --window`, which uses it only when the host has no percent. |
| tokens, calls, subagent calls, calls over 200k | `scorer live` (transcript) | Same SQL (`CTX`, `OVER_200K`) as the daily report. |
| judge calls, provider share, agreed/overrode/unsure, p50/p95 | `scorer live` (judge db, read-only) | `summarizeDecisions`, the one definition. Needs `decision_details.session_id`. |
| gates fired | `scorer live`: `decisions` joined to `decision_details` by session, grouped by question | scope-gate = `brief-scope`, done-gate = `ask-check`, send-gate = `wake-gate`. |
| wakes queued now | `scorer live`: lines in `judge/outbox/<session>.jsonl` | Same reader as the report's outbox figure. |
| context-guard fires | `scorer live`: `context-guard/fires.jsonl` lines whose `sessionId` matches | Task 2 makes the hook write `sessionId`. Old lines match no session. |

**Hook latency.** Probed on 2.1.289: a mod's `classic.SessionStart`, `classic.PreToolUse`, `classic.PostToolUse`, `classic.UserPromptSubmit` and `classic.Stop` hooks did not fire under `claude -p --plugin-dir` (the mod's `session.start`, `command.run` and `tool.call` hooks did), and a mod's `tool.call` hook times the tool and the settings hooks together (1.8 to 2.3 s with one 400 ms hook configured). So all-hook latency is **not observable from a mod** in this build, and the pane does not claim it. What it shows is the latency of the judge-backed gates (p50 per gate, from `decisions.latency_ms`, which is the slow part of those hooks). No timing record is added to the bash hooks: macOS bash 3.2 has no millisecond clock without forking `perl` (about 6 ms on `context-guard`, whose hot path is already about 68 ms), and gate latency already lives in `decisions`.

**Zero-cost proof path.** A mod's slash command runs under `claude -p` without a model call, and `--resume <session id>` hands the command the real session. So `claude -p "/live status" --resume <id> --plugin-dir mods/aw-live` exercises the whole chain (mod, `$.session`, `scorer live`, formatting) for free. Task 9 uses it, plus one pseudo-terminal run that really draws the pane.

**Optional labels.** Nothing in this plan needs a label. If `decision_details` and `eval_items` exist and the latest decision is labelable, the pane offers `y` ("this was right") and, for the two-answer question `ask-check` only, `x` ("wrong"). Each writes `judge label set <itemId> <label>` (an `override` label, Plan A). Joi does not have to press them, and no metric reads them.

## Global Constraints

- Node ≥ 20; TypeScript strict; ESM with `.js` extensions in every relative import in `scorer/` (`planning/CODE_STYLE.md`). Files are kebab-case. Zod schemas are PascalCase with a `Schema` suffix.
- `scorer/` keeps Vitest `globals: false` and **100%** lines, branches, functions and statements. Only `src/cli.ts` is excluded. **`/* v8 ignore */` is prohibited**: write the test. **No `any`.** (v8 reports a phantom uncovered branch on the closing brace of a function whose `try` and `catch` both `return`. Assign to a variable in the `try` and return after the block, as `readJudgeLive` does.)
- SQLite is additive only. The live path writes exactly one thing: `<state>/scorer/live/<session>.sqlite`. It never writes `scorer.sqlite` (the daily report's) and never writes `decisions.sqlite`; the judge database is opened `{ readonly: true, fileMustExist: true }` and a test pins that its bytes are unchanged.
- Fails open and silent. `scorer live` exits 1 with nothing on stdout on any error. The mod never throws out of a hook, never awaits a refresh inside a hook, and keeps its last good snapshot when a refresh fails.
- Mod environment rules (from the `plugin-authoring` skill and the 2026-10-04 prototype; each cost a failed run): a module holding `import()` does not load; files are `.ts`/`.tsx`; `$.env.get` takes a **literal** name (a ternary there fails `claude plugin validate`); do not name a local `h` (it is the JSX factory); the types contract file must `export type` something (a file with only `export {}` and `declare module` is not recognised); every `$.noun.method` call must be spelled in a file `validate` can follow; `$.state` keys named by the module must be declared in the contract file.
- `session_id` and `--session` values become path components. They must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`, or the command exits 1.
- Run at most ONE heavy job at a time (`npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `tsc`, builds, `claude -p` model runs), including your own verification runs. Run the full scorer suite once per commit, not per edit. Targeted `npx vitest run <file>` runs are fine between edits.
- Install nothing into Joi's live environment. Real installs run only under a throwaway `HOME` (`HOME="$(mktemp -d)"`). Joi runs the real `scripts/install-live-pane.sh --provider claude` after merging, from the main checkout (the marketplace path is baked into Claude Code's config).
- Fixtures are synthetic. Never commit a real transcript line, a real prompt or a real session id. Evidence files hold aggregates only.
- No human labeling (Joi, 2026-10-04). The `y`/`x` hotkeys are an optional override; no step, metric or test depends on one being pressed.
- Commit format `type: description`. End every commit with:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
  `Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_014AadfQDbU9tvxuKzEh5JaC`

## Review Focus

Failure modes the spec implies but no obvious test exercises; each has its pinning test in the owning task.

1. **RF-1: A session id that is a path.** `scorer live --session ../../etc/passwd` (or a name with a space or slash) must exit 1 before it touches the filesystem. It decides the live database name and the outbox file name. Pinned in Task 4 (args tests).
2. **RF-2: A judge database that predates `decision_details.session_id`, or has no `decision_details`, or is unreadable.** The pane still renders; the judge card says it is not linked yet (`unscoped`) or is absent (`none`). Pinned in Task 3 (`judgeLive` and `readJudgeLive` tests) and Task 5 (`paneSections` for `unscoped` and `none`).
3. **RF-3: `scorer` is missing, old (no `live` command), crashes, prints garbage, or a refresh is already running.** The band shows the last good numbers or nothing, nothing throws, and two refreshes never run two processes. Pinned in Task 6.
4. **RF-4: A transcript being written while we read it.** A half-written last line must not be counted, then must be counted once, exactly, when it completes. Pinned in Task 4 (`runLive` test "counts a half-written last line only once it is complete").
5. **RF-5: `/clear`, `/resume` or a new session.** The id changes mid-process. The mod must ask for the *current* id every refresh, never cache it. Pinned in Task 6.

## File structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `scorer/src/judge-stats.ts` (new) | `summarizeDecisions`: the one definition of judge calls, provider share, agreed/overrode/unsure, p50/p95 |
| `scorer/src/live-judge.ts` (new) | `judgeLive`, `readJudgeLive`, `GATES`, `JudgeLiveSchema`: this session's judge activity, read-only |
| `scorer/src/live-snapshot.ts` (new) | `LiveSnapshotSchema` (the contract) and `sessionUsage` (tokens, calls, context) |
| `scorer/src/live.ts` (new) | `runLive`, `findSessionFiles`, `pruneLiveDbs`, `renderLive` |
| `scorer/src/args.ts`, `cli.ts` | the `live` command (`cli.ts` stays the thin, coverage-excluded entry) |
| `scorer/src/metrics.ts`, `run.ts`, `transcript/discover.ts`, `outbox.ts`, `context-guard-fires.ts` | export the shared pieces the live path reuses |
| `config/hooks/context-guard.sh` | write `sessionId` on each fire |
| `mods/aw-live/` (new) | the mod: manifest, types contract, `hooks/register.tsx`, `hooks/lib/*`, `hooks/tests/*` |
| `mods/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (new) | folder marketplace `agentic-workflow-mods` (the owner tag) |
| `scripts/install-live-pane.sh`, `config/lib/tests/install-live-pane.test.sh` (new) | provider-aware, idempotent, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall` installer and its test |
| `providers/lib.sh` | add the installer to `AW_LEVER_INSTALLERS` so `setup.sh` runs it per provider |
| `scripts/live-pane-proof.py` (new) | drives a real interactive session in a pseudo-terminal to prove the pane draws |
| `docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-10-04-live-scorer-pane.md` (new) | Task 9's recorded evidence |

**Preconditions (once, in the overnight worktree, branch `feat/live-scorer-pane` per the runbook).** `ls scorer/node_modules judge/node_modules` both exist (else `npm install` in that one package, alone). `claude --version` prints 2.1.289 or newer. `python3 --version` works. Load the `plugin-authoring` skill (Skill tool) once: it writes the types file Tasks 5 and 6 type-check against.

### Task 1: Share the context-size SQL, state-dir resolution and per-session readers

The live path must not re-define what the report already defines. This task only exports and generalizes; nothing changes for the report.

**Files:**
- Modify: `scorer/src/metrics.ts` (export `CTX`; add `OVER_200K`, `OVER_400K`)
- Modify: `scorer/src/run.ts` (`resolveStateDir`; `resolveJudgeDbPath` uses it)
- Modify: `scorer/src/transcript/discover.ts` (`discoverSession`)
- Modify: `scorer/src/outbox.ts` (`queuedForSession`; export `countValidLines`)
- Modify: `scorer/src/context-guard-fires.ts` (optional `sessionId`; `firesForSession`)
- Test: `scorer/tests/discover.test.ts`, `outbox.test.ts`, `context-guard-fires.test.ts`, `run.test.ts` (append; the metrics tests already pin the SQL's numbers)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `export const CTX = "(input + cache_read + cache_creation)"`, `export const OVER_200K = 200_000`, `export const OVER_400K = 400_000` (all in `metrics.ts`)
  - `resolveStateDir(options: CliOptions): string`: explicit `--state-dir`, else `AW_STATE_DIR` (non-empty), else the default
  - `discoverSession(projectsDir: string, sessionId: string, project?: string): TranscriptFile[]`: main file plus subagents; `[]` when absent
  - `queuedForSession(dir: string, sessionId: string): number`
  - `ContextGuardFire` gains `sessionId?: string`; `firesForSession(fires: readonly ContextGuardFire[], sessionId: string): ContextGuardFire[]`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `scorer/tests/discover.test.ts` and change its import line to `import { discoverFiles, discoverSession } from "../src/transcript/discover.js";`:

```ts
describe("discoverSession", () => {
  function layout(): { root: string; proj: string } {
    const root = tmpDir();
    const proj = path.join(root, "-Users-dev-acme-web-app");
    fs.mkdirSync(path.join(proj, "s1", "subagents"), { recursive: true });
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(proj, "s1.jsonl"), "");
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(proj, "s1", "subagents", "agent-a1.jsonl"), "");
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(proj, "s1", "subagents", "agent-a1.meta.json"), JSON.stringify({ agentType: "Explore" }));
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(proj, "s2.jsonl"), "");
    return { root, proj };
  }

  it("finds the main file and its subagents in the hinted project, touching no other session", () => {
    const { root, proj } = layout();
    expect(discoverSession(root, "s1", "-Users-dev-acme-web-app")).toEqual([
      { provider: "claude", path: path.join(proj, "s1.jsonl"), project: "-Users-dev-acme-web-app", sessionId: "s1", agentId: "main", agentType: "main", isMain: true },
      { provider: "claude", path: path.join(proj, "s1", "subagents", "agent-a1.jsonl"), project: "-Users-dev-acme-web-app", sessionId: "s1", agentId: "a1", agentType: "Explore", isMain: false },
    ]);
  });

  it("scans every project when no hint is given, and finds nothing for an unknown session", () => {
    const { root } = layout();
    expect(discoverSession(root, "s2").map((f) => f.sessionId)).toEqual(["s2"]);
    expect(discoverSession(root, "nope")).toEqual([]);
  });

  it("returns nothing when the hinted project does not hold the session, or the projects dir is missing", () => {
    const { root } = layout();
    expect(discoverSession(root, "s1", "-some-other-project")).toEqual([]);
    expect(discoverSession(path.join(root, "missing"), "s1")).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

Append to `scorer/tests/outbox.test.ts` and change its import to `import { queuedForSession, readOutboxState } from "../src/outbox.js";`:

```ts
describe("queuedForSession", () => {
  it("counts only that session's valid queued lines, never another session's or expired.jsonl", () => {
    const dir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "outbox-"));
    const item = JSON.stringify({ ts: "2026-09-27T00:00:00Z", agentType: null, text: "progress" });
    writeFixture(dir, "s1.jsonl", [item, "not json", item]);
    writeFixture(dir, "s2.jsonl", [item]);
    writeFixture(dir, "expired.jsonl", [item]);
    expect(queuedForSession(dir, "s1")).toBe(2);
    expect(queuedForSession(dir, "expired")).toBe(1);
    expect(queuedForSession(dir, "missing")).toBe(0);
    expect(queuedForSession(path.join(dir, "nope"), "s1")).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

Append to `scorer/tests/context-guard-fires.test.ts` and change its import to `import { firesForSession, readFiresLog } from "../src/context-guard-fires.js";`:

```ts
describe("session ids on fires", () => {
  it("reads an optional sessionId, and firesForSession keeps only matching fires (old lines match nothing)", () => {
    const dir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "fires-"));
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir, "fires.jsonl"), [
      JSON.stringify({ ts: "2026-09-27T00:00:00Z", agentId: null, tokens: 210_000, sessionId: "s1" }),
      JSON.stringify({ ts: "2026-09-27T00:01:00Z", agentId: "a1", tokens: 220_000, sessionId: "s2" }),
      JSON.stringify({ ts: "2026-09-27T00:02:00Z", agentId: null, tokens: 230_000 }),
    ].join("\n"));
    const fires = readFiresLog(dir);
    expect(fires).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(firesForSession(fires, "s1")).toEqual([{ ts: "2026-09-27T00:00:00Z", agentId: null, tokens: 210_000, sessionId: "s1" }]);
    expect(firesForSession(fires, "s3")).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

In `scorer/tests/run.test.ts`, change the run.js import to `import { resolveJudgeDbPath, resolveProviders, resolveStateDir, runReport, transcriptRoot } from "../src/run.js";` and insert this block immediately before `describe("resolveProviders", () => {`:

```ts
describe("resolveStateDir", () => {
  const base: CliOptions = {
    command: "report", since: NOW, until: NOW, projectsDir: "/p", stateDir: "/default/state", stateDirExplicit: false, prLookup: true, contextTokensPath: null,
  };

  function withEnv(value: string | undefined, fn: () => void): void {
    const original = process.env.AW_STATE_DIR;
    if (value === undefined) delete process.env.AW_STATE_DIR;
    else process.env.AW_STATE_DIR = value;
    try {
      fn();
    } finally {
      if (original === undefined) delete process.env.AW_STATE_DIR;
      else process.env.AW_STATE_DIR = original;
    }
  }

  it("is the explicit --state-dir, else AW_STATE_DIR, else the default; an empty AW_STATE_DIR counts as unset", () => {
    withEnv("/env/state", () => expect(resolveStateDir({ ...base, stateDir: "/x", stateDirExplicit: true })).toBe("/x"));
    withEnv("/env/state", () => expect(resolveStateDir(base)).toBe("/env/state"));
    withEnv("", () => expect(resolveStateDir(base)).toBe("/default/state"));
    withEnv(undefined, () => expect(resolveStateDir(base)).toBe("/default/state"));
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, verify they fail**

Run: `cd scorer && npx vitest run tests/discover.test.ts tests/outbox.test.ts tests/context-guard-fires.test.ts tests/run.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL (`discoverSession`, `queuedForSession`, `firesForSession`, `resolveStateDir` are not exported).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`scorer/src/metrics.ts`: replace `const CTX = "(input + cache_read + cache_creation)";` with

```ts
// Shared with the live path (live-snapshot.ts): one definition of "context size of a call".
export const CTX = "(input + cache_read + cache_creation)";
export const OVER_200K = 200_000;
export const OVER_400K = 400_000;
```

and in the same file replace the three literals inside the `totals` query: `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > 200000 THEN ${CTX} ELSE 0 END` with `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > ${OVER_200K} THEN ${CTX} ELSE 0 END`; `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > 400000 THEN ${CTX} ELSE 0 END` with `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > ${OVER_400K} THEN ${CTX} ELSE 0 END`; `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > 200000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` with `CASE WHEN ${CTX} > ${OVER_200K} THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`.

`scorer/src/run.ts`: replace the whole `resolveJudgeDbPath` function (keep its comment block above it) with

```ts
export function resolveStateDir(options: CliOptions): string {
  const override = process.env.AW_STATE_DIR;
  if (options.stateDirExplicit) return options.stateDir;
  return override !== undefined && override !== "" ? override : options.stateDir;
}

export function resolveJudgeDbPath(options: CliOptions): string {
  return path.join(resolveStateDir(options), "judge", "decisions.sqlite");
}
```

`scorer/src/transcript/discover.ts`: insert before `function dirs(dir: string)`:

```ts
// One session's files without scanning every project: the caller tries the project named by
// the cwd first; with no `project`, every project directory is checked.
export function discoverSession(projectsDir: string, sessionId: string, project?: string): TranscriptFile[] {
  for (const candidate of project === undefined ? dirs(projectsDir) : [project]) {
    const projDir = path.join(projectsDir, candidate);
    const main = path.join(projDir, `${sessionId}.jsonl`);
    if (!fs.existsSync(main)) continue;
    return [
      { provider: "claude", path: main, project: candidate, sessionId, agentId: "main", agentType: "main", isMain: true },
      ...subagents(projDir, candidate, sessionId),
    ];
  }
  return [];
}

```

`scorer/src/outbox.ts`: change `function countValidLines(file: string): number {` to `export function countValidLines(file: string): number {` and append:

```ts

// Items queued for ONE session: its own <sessionId>.jsonl, never expired.jsonl.
// sessionId is validated by the CLI (args.ts) before it reaches a path.
export function queuedForSession(dir: string, sessionId: string): number {
  return countValidLines(path.join(dir, `${sessionId}.jsonl`));
}
```

`scorer/src/context-guard-fires.ts`: in `interface ContextGuardFire` add `sessionId?: string;` after `tokens: number;`; replace the `FireLineSchema` line with

```ts
const FireLineSchema = z.object({ ts: z.string(), agentId: z.string().nullable(), tokens: z.number(), sessionId: z.string().optional() });
```

and append:

```ts

// Fires written before the hook recorded a session id carry none and match no session.
export function firesForSession(fires: readonly ContextGuardFire[], sessionId: string): ContextGuardFire[] {
  return fires.filter((f) => f.sessionId === sessionId);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, verify pass; then the full suite once**

Run: `cd scorer && npx vitest run tests/discover.test.ts tests/outbox.test.ts tests/context-guard-fires.test.ts tests/run.test.ts tests/metrics.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.
Run: `cd scorer && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: typecheck clean; all tests pass; coverage 100% on every file.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add scorer/src/metrics.ts scorer/src/run.ts scorer/src/transcript/discover.ts scorer/src/outbox.ts scorer/src/context-guard-fires.ts scorer/tests/discover.test.ts scorer/tests/outbox.test.ts scorer/tests/context-guard-fires.test.ts scorer/tests/run.test.ts

### Task 2: context-guard records the session id on each fire

`fires.jsonl` lines carry no session today, so "context-guard fires this session" cannot be answered. The hook already has `$SESSION_ID` and already runs `jq` on the fire path, so this adds one `--arg` and one key.

**Files:**
- Modify: `config/hooks/context-guard.sh` (the `jq -nc` that appends to `fires.jsonl`)
- Test: `config/lib/tests/context-guard.test.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: each `fires.jsonl` line is `{"ts","agentId","sessionId","tokens"}`. `scorer/src/context-guard-fires.ts` (Task 1) reads `sessionId` as optional.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing assertion**

In `config/lib/tests/context-guard.test.sh`, in `test_fire_appends_one_line_to_fires_jsonl_non_fire_appends_nothing`, replace

```bash
  jq -e '.tokens == 255000 and .agentId == "a1"' "$cfg/fires.jsonl" > /dev/null || { echo "FAIL: fires.jsonl line shape wrong: $(cat "$cfg/fires.jsonl")"; exit 1; }
```

with

```bash
  jq -e '.tokens == 255000 and .agentId == "a1" and .sessionId == "s1"' "$cfg/fires.jsonl" > /dev/null || { echo "FAIL: fires.jsonl line shape wrong: $(cat "$cfg/fires.jsonl")"; exit 1; }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, verify it fails**

Run: `bash config/lib/tests/context-guard.test.sh`
Expected: FAIL with `fires.jsonl line shape wrong`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `config/hooks/context-guard.sh` replace

```bash

### Task 3: This session's judge activity, read-only (`summarizeDecisions`, `judgeLive`)

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/judge-stats.ts`, `scorer/src/live-judge.ts`
- Test: `scorer/tests/judge-stats.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/live-judge.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `percentile(values: readonly number[], p: number): number` from `metrics.ts` (existing, sorts internally); from Plan A Task 1 in `judge/src/db.ts`: `openDb`, `recordDecision`, `recordDecisionDetails(db, { id, input_json, probabilities, rules_opinion, agreement, session_id })`, `upsertEvalItem(db, { id, question, input_json, source, model_decision, created_at })`, the tables `decision_details` (with `session_id`) and `eval_items` (`source` is `decision:<decision id>`).
- Produces:
  - `interface DecisionFacts { provider: string; outcome: string; latency_ms: number; agreement: string | null }`
  - `interface DecisionSummary { calls: number; byProvider: Record<string, number>; undecided: number; agreed: number; overrode: number; p50LatencyMs: number; p95LatencyMs: number }`
  - `summarizeDecisions(rows: readonly DecisionFacts[]): DecisionSummary`
  - `GATES = { "scope-gate": "brief-scope", "done-gate": "ask-check", "send-gate": "wake-gate" } as const`
  - `JudgeLiveSchema` (zod discriminated union on `state`: `none` | `unscoped` | `ok`) and `type JudgeLive`
  - `judgeLive(db: JudgeDb, sessionId: string): JudgeLive`, `readJudgeLive(dbPath: string, sessionId: string): JudgeLive`

- [ ] **Step 0: Verify the dependency**

Run: `grep -n -A8 "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS decision_details" judge/src/db.ts | grep session_id && grep -n "recordDecisionDetails\|upsertEvalItem" judge/src/db.ts`
Expected: a `session_id TEXT` line inside the `decision_details` DDL, then matches for both functions. (A bare `grep session_id` is not enough: the `briefs` table already has that column.) If there is no match, Plan A Task 1 has not landed: stop, mark this task blocked ("needs Plan A Task 1"), and do not guess.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `scorer/tests/judge-stats.test.ts`:

### Task 4: `scorer live`: incremental per-session snapshot

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/live-snapshot.ts`, `scorer/src/live.ts`
- Modify (replace whole file): `scorer/src/args.ts`, `scorer/src/cli.ts`
- Test: `scorer/tests/live-snapshot.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/live.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/args.test.ts` (edit)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 (`CTX`, `OVER_200K`, `resolveStateDir`, `discoverSession`, `queuedForSession`, `firesForSession`, `readFiresLog`); Task 3 (`readJudgeLive`, `JudgeLiveSchema`); existing `ingestAll(db, files): FormatHealth` (`.lines` = new lines), `openDb(path)`, `projectFromCwd(cwd)`, `formatTokens`/`formatPct` from `render.ts`.
- Produces:
  - `LiveSnapshotSchema` / `type LiveSnapshot` (v 1): `{ v:1, sessionId, at, transcript:{found,files}, ingest:{newLines,ms}, context:{tokens|null,window,percent|null}, usage:{calls,subagentCalls,contextTokens,outputTokens,callsOver200k}, judge: JudgeLive, contextGuard:{fires}, wakes:{queuedNow} }`
  - `sessionUsage(db: Db, window: number): Pick<LiveSnapshot, "context" | "usage">`
  - `findSessionFiles(projectsDir, sessionId, cwd: string | null): TranscriptFile[]`, `pruneLiveDbs(dir, keepSession, nowMs): number`, `runLive(options: CliOptions, nowMs?: () => number): LiveSnapshot`, `renderLive(s: LiveSnapshot): string`
  - CLI: `scorer live --session <id> [--cwd DIR] [--window TOKENS] [--json] [--projects-dir DIR] [--state-dir DIR]`. `CliOptions` gains `liveSession`, `liveCwd`, `liveWindow` (default 200000), `json`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Edit `scorer/tests/args.test.ts`: in the first test ("defaults to a one-day report") replace `      contextTokensPath: null,\n    } });` with

```ts
      contextTokensPath: null, liveSession: null, liveCwd: null, liveWindow: 200_000, json: false,
    } });
```

then add this test before the `it("accepts --provider (single, list, all)` test:

```ts
  it("accepts the live command with its flags", () => {
    const r = parseArgs(["live", "--session", "abc-123_4.5", "--cwd", "/repo", "--window", "1000000", "--json", "--state-dir", "/s"], NOW, HOME);
    expect(r).toEqual({ ok: true, options: expect.objectContaining({
      command: "live", liveSession: "abc-123_4.5", liveCwd: "/repo", liveWindow: 1_000_000, json: true, stateDir: "/s", stateDirExplicit: true,
    }) });
  });
```

and these rows to the `it.each([...])("rejects %j"` table, after the `context-tokens` row (RF-1 is the `../etc/passwd` row):

```ts
    [["live"], "live needs --session <id>"],
    [["live", "--session"], "--session needs a value"],
    [["live", "--session", "../etc/passwd"], "--session must be letters, digits, '.', '_' or '-': ../etc/passwd"],
    [["live", "--session", "a b"], "--session must be letters, digits, '.', '_' or '-': a b"],
    [["live", "--session", "s1", "--window", "0"], "--window must be a positive integer: 0"],
    [["live", "--session", "s1", "--window", "big"], "--window must be a positive integer: big"],
    [["live", "--session", "s1", "--window", "1.5"], "--window must be a positive integer: 1.5"],
```

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, verify pass; then the full suite once**

Run: `cd scorer && npx vitest run tests/args.test.ts tests/live-snapshot.test.ts tests/live.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (args 22+, live-snapshot 4, live 12).
Run: `cd scorer && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: clean; all pass; 100% on every file.

- [ ] **Step 5: CLI smoke against a build**

Run:
```bash
cd scorer && npm run build && ST="$(mktemp -d)" && node dist/cli.js live --session smoke-1 --projects-dir "$ST/none" --state-dir "$ST" --json; echo "exit=$?"
node dist/cli.js live; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: the first prints one JSON line containing `"v":1`, `"transcript":{"found":false,"files":0}`, `"judge":{"state":"none"}` and `exit=0`, and creates no `$ST/scorer` directory (`ls "$ST"` shows nothing). The second prints `scorer: live needs --session <id>` plus the usage line to stderr and `exit=1`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add scorer/src/live-snapshot.ts scorer/src/live.ts scorer/src/args.ts scorer/src/cli.ts scorer/tests/live-snapshot.test.ts scorer/tests/live.test.ts scorer/tests/args.test.ts

### Task 5: The mod's manifest, types contract and pure libraries

A mod is three files plus its contract (`plugin-authoring` skill, "WHERE TO WRITE IT"). Everything that can be pure is pure and lives in `hooks/lib/`; `register.tsx` (Task 6) owns every `$` call.

**Files:**
- Create: `mods/aw-live/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `mods/aw-live/hooks/hooks.json`, `mods/aw-live/types/index.d.ts`
- Create: `mods/aw-live/hooks/lib/snapshot.ts`, `format.ts`, `labels.ts`, `refresh.ts`
- Create: `mods/aw-live/hooks/register.tsx` (an empty scaffold; Task 6 replaces it)
- Create: `mods/aw-live/hooks/tests/fixtures/sample.ts`, `mods/aw-live/hooks/tests/lib.test.ts`
- Create: `scorer/tests/live-contract.test.ts`
- Modify: `.gitignore` (the engine lays `.claude-plugin/types/` into a loaded mod; do not commit it)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the JSON `scorer live --json` prints (Task 4, `LiveSnapshotSchema`).
- Produces (all in `mods/aw-live/`):
  - `types/index.d.ts`: `LiveSnapshot`, `JudgeLive`, `JudgeLatest`, `GateName`, `GateStats`, `HostUsage`, `LiveStatus`, and `PluginState['aw-live'] = { snapshot, host, status }`
  - `lib/snapshot.ts`: `parseSnapshot(text: string): LiveSnapshot | null`
  - `lib/format.ts`: `fmtTokens`, `cut`, `bar`, `contextPercent`, `providerShare`, `bandText(s, host, columns): string | null`, `paneSections(s, host): Section[]`, `statusText(s | null, host): string`, `WARN_PERCENT`, types `Tone`, `Row`, `Section`
  - `lib/labels.ts`: `FLIP`, `LabelKind`, `labelFor(latest: JudgeLatest, kind: LabelKind): string | null`
  - `lib/refresh.ts`: `TIMER_MS = 10_000`, `MIN_GAP_MS = 2_000`, `RUN_TIMEOUT_MS = 5_000`, `liveArgs(sessionId, cwd, window | null): string[]`, `binCandidates(home | undefined, 'scorer' | 'judge', override?): string[]`, `isDue(lastAt | null, now, minGapMs?): boolean`
  - fixture `SAMPLE_JSON: string` (a valid snapshot with an `ok` judge, `labelable: true`, latest `ask-check` decision `d-9` with `itemId` `item-9`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the manifest, contract and fixture** (data, no behavior yet)

Create `mods/aw-live/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "aw-live",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Live scorer numbers inside Claude Code: a /live pane and a one-line band for context, cost, judge activity, gates and wakes.",
  "author": { "name": "agentic-workflow" },
  "types": "./types/index.d.ts"
}
```

Create `mods/aw-live/hooks/hooks.json`:

```json
{ "modules": ["./register.tsx"] }
```

Create `mods/aw-live/types/index.d.ts`:

```ts
export type GateName = 'scope-gate' | 'done-gate' | 'send-gate'

export type GateStats = {
  question: string
  fired: number

  p50LatencyMs: number
}

export type JudgeLatest = {
  id: string
  ts: string
  question: string
  decision: string
  provider: string
  confidence: number
  /** The eval_items id for this decision, once `judge label import` has made one. */
  itemId: string | null
}

export type JudgeLive =

      p95LatencyMs: number
      gates: Record<GateName, GateStats>
      labelable: boolean
      latest: JudgeLatest | null
    }

export type LiveSnapshot = {
  v: 1
  sessionId: string
  at: string
  transcript: { found: boolean; files: number }
  ingest: { newLines: number; ms: number }
  context: { tokens: number | null; window: number; percent: number | null }
  usage: { calls: number; subagentCalls: number; contextTokens: number; outputTokens: number; callsOver200k: number }
  judge: JudgeLive
  contextGuard: { fires: number }
  wakes: { queuedNow: number }
}

/** What the host itself reports; shown in preference to the transcript's estimate. */
export type HostUsage = { usd: number | null; percent: number | null; window: number | null }

export type LiveStatus = { ok: boolean; at: number }

declare module 'claude-code' {
  interface PluginState {
    'aw-live': { snapshot: LiveSnapshot | null; host: HostUsage | null; status: LiveStatus | null }
  }
}
```

Create `mods/aw-live/hooks/tests/fixtures/sample.ts`:

```ts
// A synthetic `scorer live --json` result. scorer/tests/live-contract.test.ts reads this
// file as text, takes the JSON between the backticks and validates it against the zod
// schema, so edit the JSON, not the delimiters.

  },
  "contextGuard": { "fires": 1 },
  "wakes": { "queuedNow": 2 }
}`
```

```tsx
// mods/aw-live/hooks/register.tsx  (scaffold; Task 6 replaces it)
import type { Register } from 'claude-code'

export const register: Register = () => {}
```

Append to `.gitignore`:

```
# Claude Code lays the function-hooks API types into a mod it loads

Run: `claude plugin test mods/aw-live`
Expected: `10 pass`, `0 fail` (the `lib.test.ts` tests).
Run: `cd scorer && npx vitest run tests/live-contract.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (the mod's sample parses with the scorer's `LiveSnapshotSchema`).

Run:
```bash

### Task 6: The hooks module: refresh loop, band, pane, `/live`, optional labels

**Files:**
- Replace: `mods/aw-live/hooks/register.tsx`
- Create: `mods/aw-live/hooks/tests/register.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 5's libs and contract; `$.session.id/cwd/usage`, `$.env.get`, `$.process.run`, `$.clock.now/every/after`, `$.command.register`, `$.ui.open/close/panes/resolve/toast`, `atom/read/update` from `claude-code`.
- Produces: the registered hooks: `session.start` (registers `/live`, starts the 10 s timer, first refresh), `turn.complete` (a refresh via `$.clock.after(0, …)`; returns at once), `command.run {command:'live'}` (toggle pane; `status` argument answers with text), `ui.render` for `AbovePrompt` (the band) and `Pane` id `aw-live`. Refresh = one `scorer live --json` per at most 2 s, joined if one is running.

Behavior facts the tests pin: the refresh never runs inside the awaited part of a hook; the CLI is looked up as `AW_SCORER_BIN`, then `$HOME/.local/bin/scorer`, then `scorer`; a failed or garbage answer keeps the last snapshot; `y`/`x` exist only when `judge.labelable` and there is a latest decision, and `x` only for two-answer questions.

// aw-live: the scorer's numbers for THIS session, live inside Claude Code.
// `/live` toggles a pane; a one-line band above the prompt shows the headline.
// Every number comes from `scorer live --json` (one short Node process, never
// in-process: a mod has no Node and cannot load better-sqlite3). A refresh never
// blocks a hook and every failure is silent: the band just keeps its last value.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, verify pass**

Run: `claude plugin validate mods/aw-live`

Run: `claude plugin test mods/aw-live`
Expected: 31 pass, 0 fail (10 in `lib.test.ts`, 21 in `register.test.ts`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Type-check** (same command as Task 5 Step 6)

Expected: no output, exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add mods/aw-live/hooks/register.tsx mods/aw-live/hooks/tests/register.test.ts

### Task 7: Installer, marketplace, `setup.sh` wiring and docs

The install path follows the repo's lever convention: one `scripts/install-<lever>.sh --provider X`, owner-tagged, idempotent, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall`, a bash test with a throwaway `HOME` and a stubbed CLI. The owner tag is the marketplace name `agentic-workflow-mods` and plugin `aw-live`; the installer touches only those two ids.

**Files:**
- Create: `mods/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `scripts/install-live-pane.sh`, `config/lib/tests/install-live-pane.test.sh`
- Modify: `providers/lib.sh` (`AW_LEVER_INSTALLERS`, banner)
- Modify: `AGENTS.md`, `planning/PROVIDERS.md`, `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `aw_parse_provider_args`, `aw_hooks_init`, `aw_unsupported` from `config/hooks/adapters/install-lib.sh`; `AW_DRY_RUN`; `CLAUDE_LOCAL_BIN`.
- Produces: `scripts/install-live-pane.sh [--provider claude|codex|cursor] [--dry-run] [--uninstall]`. `setup.sh` runs it for every selected provider through `aw_install_levers`; in `--dry-run` it prints `[dry-run] would run scripts/install-live-pane.sh --provider <p>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `config/lib/tests/install-live-pane.test.sh`:

```bash

- after the line `├── scorer/        # Daily cost/involvement report from provider session transcripts` add `├── mods/          # Claude Code mods (in-process function hooks): aw-live pane + band. Claude-only`;
- after the line `scorer --since 7d [--provider claude|codex|cursor|all]  # Report to ~/.agentic-workflow/scorer/reports/` add `scorer live --session <id> [--cwd DIR] [--json]  # This session's numbers (the aw-live mod calls it)`;
- after the line `(cd skills/bugFixOrchestrator && npm test)  # Vitest (bugfix-state CLI)` add `claude plugin validate mods/aw-live && claude plugin test mods/aw-live  # the aw-live mod (needs claude >= 2.1.289)`;
- in Merge Gate item 2, append `, and \`claude plugin validate mods/aw-live\` and \`claude plugin test mods/aw-live\` pass` before the final period.

In `planning/PROVIDERS.md` add this row directly after the `| Scorer |` row of the Canonical layout table:

```
| Live pane | `mods/aw-live` (a Claude Code mod) + `scorer live` | Claude only. Codex and Cursor keep the statusline segments and the daily report |
```

and add this paragraph after the **Scorer.** paragraph:

```
**Mods.** `mods/aw-live` is a Claude Code mod (in-process function hooks, `claude plugin test`). It shows
this session's `scorer live` numbers in a `/live` pane and a band. Mods have no Codex or Cursor
equivalent, so `scripts/install-live-pane.sh --provider codex|cursor` prints a skip note and writes
nothing. Install: `scripts/install-live-pane.sh` (a folder marketplace named `agentic-workflow-mods`).
```

In `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`, immediately before the `## Key Rules` heading add:

```
`scorer live --session <id> [--cwd DIR] [--json]` is the per-session, incremental view of the same
figures: it ingests only that session's transcripts into `~/.agentic-workflow/scorer/live/<session>.sqlite`
(never `scorer.sqlite`), reads the judge database read-only, and shares its SQL and statistics with the
daily report (`CTX`, `OVER_200K`, `percentile`, `summarizeDecisions`). The `aw-live` mod (`mods/aw-live/`)
renders it inside Claude Code.

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, verify pass**

Run: `chmod +x scripts/install-live-pane.sh && bash config/lib/tests/install-live-pane.test.sh`
Expected: eight `PASS:` lines (one may read `SKIP:` if `claude` lives in `/usr/bin`) and `All install-live-pane tests passed.`
Run: `bash providers/tests/install.test.sh && scripts/sync-rules.sh --check`
Expected: both exit 0.
Run: `./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run | grep -c "would run scripts/install-live-pane.sh"`
Expected: `3`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Real CLI, throwaway HOME** (the installer against the real `claude`, touching nothing of Joi's)

Run:
```bash
H="$(mktemp -d)"
# Subshell, so the orchestrator's own HOME and env are untouched. HOME alone is not enough if
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is set in the parent shell, so pin it too.
(
  export HOME="$H" CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$H/.claude"
  bash scripts/install-live-pane.sh
  claude plugin list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.id=="aw-live@agentic-workflow-mods") | .id, .enabled, .readFromFolder'
  bash scripts/install-live-pane.sh   # idempotent
  bash scripts/install-live-pane.sh --uninstall
  claude plugin list --json
)
```
Expected: the first run prints `marketplace agentic-workflow-mods -> <repo>/mods` and `aw-live@agentic-workflow-mods installed` (plus a `WARN` that `~/.local/bin/scorer` in the throwaway HOME has no `live` command, which is correct there). The `jq` line prints the id, `true`, and `<repo>/mods/aw-live`. The second run prints `up to date` and `already installed`, no `Successfully` lines. After `--uninstall` the list is `[]`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add mods/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json scripts/install-live-pane.sh config/lib/tests/install-live-pane.test.sh providers/lib.sh AGENTS.md planning/PROVIDERS.md planning/ARCHITECTURE.md

### Task 8: Report and live agree (gated on Plan A Task 7)

The goal is one definition per figure. Plan A Task 7 adds `undecided`, `agreed`, `overrode`, `p50LatencyMs`, `byProvider` to the report's `JudgeReportRow`, written inline. This task pins that the report and the live path give the same answer on the same decisions, so they cannot drift.

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/tests/live-report-consistency.test.ts`
- Modify (only if the test fails): `scorer/src/judge-section.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `judgeSection(db, sinceIso): JudgeReportRow[]` with Plan A Task 7's fields; `judgeLive` (Task 3); `summarizeDecisions` (Task 3).

- [ ] **Step 0: Gate**

Run: `grep -n "byProvider" scorer/src/judge-section.ts`
Expected: at least one match (Plan A Task 7 landed). If there is none, skip this whole task, record "deferred: Plan A Task 7 not landed" in the PR description, and continue to Task 9.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

```ts
// scorer/tests/live-report-consistency.test.ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

import { openDb, recordDecision, recordDecisionDetails } from "../../judge/src/db.js";
import type { DecisionRow } from "../../judge/src/db.js";
import { judgeSection } from "../src/judge-section.js";
import { judgeLive } from "../src/live-judge.js";

// One question, one session: the daily report and the live pane must compute the same figures
// from the same decisions. If this fails, make judge-section.ts compute the failing field with
// summarizeDecisions (./judge-stats.js) instead of changing this test.
describe("report and live agree", () => {
  it("gives the same provider share, agreement counts and latency percentiles", () => {
    const db = openDb(":memory:");
    const rows: Array<[string, string, number, "agreed" | "overrode" | "undecided", DecisionRow["outcome"]]> = [
      ["a", "jev", 300, "agreed", "decided"],
      ["b", "jev", 400, "overrode", "decided"],
      ["c", "rules", 0, "undecided", "decided"],
      ["d", "jev", 380, "agreed", "decided"],
      ["e", "claude-cli", 6200, "agreed", "decided"],
    ];
    for (const [id, provider, latency, agreement, outcome] of rows) {
      recordDecision(db, {
        id, ts: "2026-10-03T10:00:00.000Z", question: "ask-check", content_class: "brief", provider, decision: "continue", confidence: 0.9,
        reason_code: provider, latency_ms: latency, input_digest: "x", undone_at: null, chain_position: 0, skipped: [], outcome,
      });
      recordDecisionDetails(db, { id, input_json: "{}", probabilities: null, rules_opinion: null, agreement, session_id: "s1" });
    }
    const [report] = judgeSection(db, "2026-10-01T00:00:00.000Z");
    const live = judgeLive(db, "s1");
    if (live.state !== "ok") throw new Error("expected an ok judge");
    expect(report).toMatchObject({
      byProvider: live.byProvider, agreed: live.agreed, overrode: live.overrode, undecided: live.undecided,
      p50LatencyMs: live.p50LatencyMs, p95LatencyMs: live.p95LatencyMs,
    });
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run**

Run: `cd scorer && npx vitest run tests/live-report-consistency.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. If it fails on a field, import `summarizeDecisions` into `judge-section.ts`, build its `DecisionFacts` rows from the question's decisions left-joined to `decision_details`, and take that field from the summary; re-run until it passes, and run Plan A's `scorer/tests/judge-section.test.ts` too (it must still pass unchanged).

- [ ] **Step 3: Full suite once, then commit**

Run: `cd scorer && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage`
Expected: clean, 100%.

```bash
git add scorer/tests/live-report-consistency.test.ts scorer/src/judge-section.ts
git commit -m "test: the daily report and the live pane compute judge figures identically" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_014AadfQDbU9tvxuKzEh5JaC"
```

### Task 9: Proof in a real Claude Code, and the evidence file

Four independent proofs, cheapest first. Each result is recorded in the evidence file. A failing proof is a finding, not a reason to edit earlier tasks' behavior: record it, then fix in a follow-up commit only if it is a plain bug.

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/live-pane-proof.py` (executable)
- Create: `docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-10-04-live-scorer-pane.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above; `claude` ≥ 2.1.289 logged in; a built scorer (`cd scorer && npm run build` was run in Task 4).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the pseudo-terminal harness**

Create `scripts/live-pane-proof.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Drive a real interactive Claude Code session in a pseudo-terminal and prove the aw-live
pane renders: start `claude --plugin-dir <mod>`, send one tiny prompt (so the session has a
transcript), open /live, capture the screen text, and check the pane's sections are on it.

Evidence, not a test suite: it spends one haiku turn. Run it from a directory Claude Code
already trusts (the main checkout), or the folder-trust dialog eats the first keystrokes.

  scripts/live-pane-proof.py --plugin-dir mods/aw-live --cwd . --out evidence.txt
  env passed through: AW_SCORER_BIN, AW_STATE_DIR, AW_JUDGE_BIN (point them at a build and a scratch dir)

    sys.exit(main())
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/live-pane-proof.py`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Proof A: the contract and the installer** (no model call)

Run:
```bash
claude --version
claude plugin validate mods
claude plugin validate mods/aw-live
claude plugin test mods/aw-live
```
Expected: `2.1.289 (Claude Code)` or newer; validation passes for both paths (a `plugins[0].source ... is or traverses a symlink` warning must NOT appear: `mods/aw-live` is a real directory); tests `0 fail`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Proof B: warm latency of `scorer live`** (no model call; the transcript is synthetic)

Write `$TMP/bench.mjs` and run it from the repo root (`cd scorer && npm run build` was done in Task 4):

```bash
REPO="$PWD"; TMP="$(mktemp -d)"; export REPO TMP
cat > "$TMP/bench.mjs" <<'EOF'
import { spawnSync } from "node:child_process";
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

const { REPO, TMP } = process.env;
const dir = path.join(TMP, "projects", "-work-bench");
fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
const file = path.join(dir, "bench-1.jsonl");
const line = (i, ts) => JSON.stringify({
  type: "assistant", uuid: `u${i}`, sessionId: "bench-1", isSidechain: false, timestamp: ts,
  message: { id: `m${i}`, model: "claude-opus-5-5", role: "assistant", content: [{ type: "text", text: "x".repeat(200) }],
    usage: { input_tokens: 5, cache_read_input_tokens: 40000 + i, cache_creation_input_tokens: 100, output_tokens: 50 } },
});
const ts = (i) => new Date(Date.UTC(2026, 9, 4, 10, 0, 0) + i * 1000).toISOString();
fs.writeFileSync(file, Array.from({ length: 20000 }, (_, i) => line(i, ts(i))).join("\n") + "\n");

const run = () => {
  const t0 = performance.now();
  const r = spawnSync("node", [path.join(REPO, "scorer/dist/cli.js"), "live", "--session", "bench-1", "--cwd", "/work/bench",
    "--projects-dir", path.join(TMP, "projects"), "--state-dir", path.join(TMP, "state"), "--json"], { encoding: "utf8" });
  return { ms: performance.now() - t0, snap: JSON.parse(r.stdout) };
};
const cold = run();
console.log(`cold_ms=${Math.round(cold.ms)} calls=${cold.snap.usage.calls} newLines=${cold.snap.ingest.newLines}`);
const warm = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i += 1) {
  fs.appendFileSync(file, line(20000 + i, ts(20000 + i)) + "\n");
  const r = run();
  if (r.snap.ingest.newLines !== 1) throw new Error(`expected 1 new line, got ${r.snap.ingest.newLines}`);
  warm.push(r.ms);
}
warm.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(`warm_median_ms=${Math.round(warm[7])} warm_max_ms=${Math.round(warm[14])}`);
EOF
node "$TMP/bench.mjs"
```
Expected: `cold_ms=` a second or so (the one-time full ingest of 20,000 lines; `calls=20000`, `newLines=20000`) and `warm_median_ms=` **under 200** (each warm run ingests exactly one new line, which the script asserts). Record both. If the median is over 200 on a busy machine, re-run once; if it stays over, record the number as a finding and do not change the target.

- [ ] **Step 4: Proof C: the whole chain through a real session, as text** (one haiku turn, about $0.05)

`REPO` and `TMP` come from Step 3 (set `REPO="$PWD"` again if the shell was reset). Run:

```bash
W="$(mktemp -d)"; ST="$(mktemp -d)"; export W ST
printf '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexec node %s/scorer/dist/cli.js "$@"\n' "$REPO" > "$W/scorer"; chmod +x "$W/scorer"
export CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=1
SID="$(cd "$W" && AW_STATE_DIR="$ST" claude -p "reply with the single word ok" --model haiku --output-format json </dev/null | jq -r .session_id)"; export SID; echo "session=$SID"
(cd "$W" && AW_STATE_DIR="$ST" AW_SCORER_BIN="$W/scorer" claude -p "/live status" --resume "$SID" --plugin-dir "$REPO/mods/aw-live" --output-format json </dev/null | jq -r .result)
(cd "$W" && AW_STATE_DIR="$ST" "$W/scorer" live --session "$SID" --cwd "$W" --projects-dir "$HOME/.claude/projects")
```
Expected: the `/live status` text starts `live · ctx N% · $0.0x · K calls`, has `context`, `session`, `judge` and `wakes` sections (the `judge` card reads `not linked yet …` if the installed judge predates Plan A, nothing numeric otherwise), and its `calls` and `tokens` equal the direct `scorer live` output on the last command (the same K calls). Record the text. (`CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=1` is needed because a session started from inside another Claude Code session otherwise does not save its transcript.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Proof D: judge scoping end to end** (no model call; reuses `$SID`, `$ST`, `$W`, `$REPO`)

Build judge first (its `dist` predates Plan A's tables): `cd judge && npm run build && cd ..`. Then seed three decisions for this session and read them back through the mod:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
const { openDb, recordDecision, recordDecisionDetails } = await import(process.env.REPO + "/judge/dist/db.js");
const db = openDb(process.env.ST + "/judge/decisions.sqlite");
const mk = (id, q, provider, decision, latency, agreement) => {
  recordDecision(db, { id, ts: new Date().toISOString(), question: q, content_class: "brief", provider, decision, confidence: 0.9, reason_code: provider, latency_ms: latency, input_digest: "x", undone_at: null, chain_position: 0, skipped: [], outcome: "decided" });
  recordDecisionDetails(db, { id, input_json: "{}", probabilities: null, rules_opinion: null, agreement, session_id: process.env.SID });
};
mk("proof-1", "brief-scope", "jev", "ready", 400, "agreed");
mk("proof-2", "ask-check", "jev", "continue", 350, "overrode");
mk("proof-3", "wake-gate", "rules", "send", 0, "undecided");
db.close();
'
export CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=1
(cd "$W" && AW_STATE_DIR="$ST" AW_SCORER_BIN="$W/scorer" claude -p "/live status" --resume "$SID" --plugin-dir "$REPO/mods/aw-live" --output-format json </dev/null | jq -r .result)
```
Expected: the `judge` card has a `calls` row reading `3 · jev 67% · rules 33%` and a `vs rules` row reading `agreed 1 · overrode 1 · unsure 1`; the `gates` card shows `scope-gate`, `done-gate` and `send-gate` rows reading `1 · ready 1 · p50 400 ms`, `1 · continue 1 · p50 350 ms` and `1 · send 1 · p50 0 ms`. Rows that the hooks of Step 4's `claude` runs wrote with another or no session id must not appear in these counts (that is the scoping working). Record the text.

- [ ] **Step 6: Proof E: the pane really draws** (a pseudo-terminal, one haiku turn, about $0.05)

Run with `cwd` the **main checkout**: Claude Code already trusts it, and an untrusted directory shows a folder-trust dialog that swallows the keystrokes. This starts a real new interactive session there; nothing is edited. `W`, `REPO`, `TMP` come from Steps 3 and 4.

```bash
ST2="$(mktemp -d)"
AW_STATE_DIR="$ST2" AW_SCORER_BIN="$W/scorer" python3 "$REPO/scripts/live-pane-proof.py" \
  --plugin-dir "$REPO/mods/aw-live" --cwd /Users/joi/personal/agentic-workflow --out "$TMP/pane.txt"; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: `captured N chars; missing: none; percent shown: True` and `exit=0`. Then Read `$TMP/pane.txt` and confirm with your own eyes that it holds the `/live` slash-menu entry `Toggle the live scorer pane`, a boxed `context` section with `window  NN% ▓▓…░░`, a `session` box with `cost`, `calls`, `over 200k`, and a `wakes` box with `queued now` and `context guard`. The capture is a stream of terminal redraws, so lines repeat; judge by the presence of the sections and numbers. If the harness times out (slow start, a dialog), re-run once; if it still fails, record `proof E: not obtained` with the last 40 lines of `$TMP/pane.txt`, and rely on the `claude plugin test` mount tests (they draw the pane on the terminal and desktop surfaces).

- [ ] **Step 7: Write the evidence file** `docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-10-04-live-scorer-pane.md`

Contents (fill the bracketed values from the runs above; aggregates only, no real prompts, paths or transcript lines):

```markdown
# Evidence: live scorer pane (Plan D)

- Claude Code: `claude --version` = [value]. Date: 2026-10-04 (or the run date).
- Proof A (validate + test): [pass/fail], `claude plugin test mods/aw-live` = [N pass, 0 fail].
- Proof B (latency of `scorer live`, 20,000-line synthetic transcript, `$TMP/bench.mjs`): cold [N] ms, warm median [N] ms over 15 runs each ingesting one line. Target < 200 ms warm: [met/not met].
- Proof C (`/live status` through `claude -p --resume`): [paste the status text]. `calls` and `tokens` matched the direct `scorer live` output: [yes/no].
- Proof D (judge scoping, three seeded decisions for the session): [paste the judge and gates lines]. Rows from other sessions excluded: [yes/no].
- Proof E (pane drawn in a real interactive session): [obtained/not obtained]. Lines seen: [the `window`, `cost`, `calls`, `queued now` lines].
- Findings: hook latency is not observable from a mod in this build (classic hooks did not fire under `claude -p --plugin-dir`; `tool.call` times tool and hooks together). Shown instead: per-gate p50 from `decisions.latency_ms`.
- Not proven here: the install into Joi's real `~/.claude` (run `scripts/install-live-pane.sh --provider claude` from the main checkout after merge); the y/x override labels against a real labelable decision (Plan A Task 3 must be installed first).
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/live-pane-proof.py docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-10-04-live-scorer-pane.md
git commit -m "docs: evidence for the live scorer pane (real session, latency, judge scoping)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

---

## Done when

- The merge gate in `AGENTS.md` passes: `scorer` typecheck and coverage at 100%, `claude plugin validate mods/aw-live` and `claude plugin test mods/aw-live`, every bash test (including `install-live-pane.test.sh` and `context-guard.test.sh`), `scripts/sync-rules.sh --check`, and `./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run` (which now prints the live-pane line for each provider).
- `scorer live --session <id> --json` returns a schema-valid snapshot, ingests only appended bytes on the second call, and is under 200 ms warm (Task 9, Proof B).
- The pane, the band and `/live status` show context, cost, calls, judge activity, gates, queued wakes and context-guard fires for the current session, and were observed in a real session (Proofs C, D, E).
- Claude-only is stated in `PROVIDERS.md`, in the installer's output for Codex and Cursor, and in the PR description.
- No step required Joi to label anything.

- **Spec coverage:** per-session live query (Tasks 3, 4); the numbers listed in the brief: context % (host plus transcript), session cost (host) and tokens (Task 4), calls over 200k (Task 4), judge calls / provider share / undecided / agreed / overrode / p50 (Tasks 3, 4), gates (Task 3), wakes (Task 4), context-guard fires (Tasks 2, 4), hook latency (decision: per-gate latency, rest not observable; Proof findings); the mod pane, band, `/live status`, refresh on turn end and timer, never blocking, silent (Tasks 5, 6); optional hotkeys (Task 6); Claude-only (stated, installer, docs); install with `--dry-run`, owner tag, idempotent, bash test (Task 7); report and live share code (Tasks 1, 3, 8); proof in a real session (Task 9).
- **Placeholder scan:** none; every code step carries the code. The two data-dependent steps (Proof B/D numbers) say exactly what to record.
- **Type consistency:** `LiveSnapshot` is defined once by `LiveSnapshotSchema` (scorer) and once structurally in `mods/aw-live/types/index.d.ts`, and `scorer/tests/live-contract.test.ts` parses the mod's sample with the scorer's schema. `GateName`, `JudgeLatest`, `labelFor`, `binCandidates(home, name, override?)`, `liveArgs(sessionId, cwd, window | null)` are used with the same signatures in Tasks 5 and 6.
- **Review Focus:** RF-1 to RF-5 each name their pinning test and task.
