# Sindri Plan 1: Measure + Standalone Fixes Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship Sindri rollout step 0 (measurement baselines) and the two standalone step-1 fixes that later plans depend on (done-gate false positives, and a judge `--providers` allowlist), then **switch them on** so they start serving the rest of the build (spec §13.3 ladder, rows 1–3).

**Architecture:** Measurement is a new `scorer audit` subcommand. It reuses scorer's transcript discovery and `classifyUserText` to extract human turns, count recurring-direction patterns, and compute per-item token usage. Copies of human turns that resumed and forked sessions write into a new transcript are deduped by (timestamp, text). It writes JSONL, JSON and a Markdown baseline. An optional model labeler (`--label`) calibrates the regex patterns against adjudicator labels and measures how often wrong-approach corrections happen. The done-gate change replaces a bare-word regex with a small claim detector that ignores questions, negations, tables and code. The judge change adds a chain filter, so callers (later, Sindri) can restrict which providers a question may use.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.7 strict, ESM (Node16 resolution), Node >= 20, Vitest, Zod 3; bash + jq for hooks.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-sindri-design.md`. This plan implements §13 step 0 (including dedupe, pattern calibration and the wrong-approach measurement), plus these step-1 items: "done-gate fix" (§5.3 coexistence, §7.6/§7.7 first self-proposal) and "judge `--providers` flag" (§6.1 Providers and egress, M1/M2).

Later plans cover the rest of step 1:
- Plan 2: Sindri core package (profile, ledger, lock and fencing, scrubber, CLI skeleton)
- Plan 3: host code index
- Plan 4: scoping harness with `--backtest`
- Plan 5: ported pstack skills, artifact registry and offline self-evolution

## Global Constraints

- Node >= 20, TypeScript 5.7 strict mode, ESM with Node16 module resolution (AGENTS.md Tech Stack).
- No `any` types outside Fastify integration boundaries. No `/* v8 ignore */` annotations (AGENTS.md Merge Gate 5–6).
- Tests: Vitest for TS packages; bash test scripts for hooks, run with `bash <file>` (AGENTS.md Commands).
- One heavy job at a time: run `npm test` / typecheck once per commit, not per edit (global CLAUDE.md).
- Core stays generic. No workplace-specific names, labels, ticket prefixes or hosts in code or defaults. Use generic defaults (item pattern `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-\d+`) that a profile overrides (spec §4.3, memory "generic core").
- No human hand-labeling. Labels come from outcomes or a model adjudicator, never the builder. Regex patterns are floor counts until calibrated against adjudicator labels (spec §2, §13 step 0).
- Commit format: `type: short description`, atomic commits (AGENTS.md Commit Conventions).

## Review Focus

1. **Transcripts with malformed or partial lines.** A truncated last line, non-JSON lines, or unknown record types must be skipped, not crash the audit. Pinned in Task 3.
2. **Done claims inside quotes, tables or code fences.** "`ready for review`" inside a markdown table or a fenced block is not a claim. Pinned in Task 1.
3. **Negated or hedged claims.** "nothing is finished", "not done yet", "isn't complete" must not count as claims. Pinned in Task 1.
4. **`--providers` naming an unknown provider or listing none.** It must exit with a usage error, not silently fall back to the full chain. Pinned in Task 2.
5. **Huge transcript corpora.** The audit streams files line by line and never loads a whole file into memory. Pinned in Task 3 (large-file test).
6. **Resumed and forked copies.** The same turn (same timestamp and text) in two session files is counted once; the same text at a different timestamp, and any turn with an empty timestamp, is never deduped. Pinned in Task 5.
7. **Labeler hygiene.** Turn text is untrusted data (fenced, tags neutralized), the child is spawned with `execFile` (no shell), a timeout, an env allowlist, no tools, no MCP servers, no session file and no hooks or CLAUDE.md (`--safe-mode`, so the user's own hooks never see turn text), run from a private temp directory, and its output is Zod-validated with one retry. Pinned in Task 6.
8. **Pattern gating.** A pattern is `metric-grade` only with both Wilson lower bounds at least 0.6 and at least 10 positives; everything else is `floor only`. `image_turn` counts image attachments, not defects. Pinned in Task 6.
9. **Privacy.** Labeling sends turn text to the host's own model provider only when `--label > 0`; outputs stay under `~/.agentic-workflow/audit`; `labels.jsonl` and `human-turns.jsonl` are never committed or posted, and the PR comment carries aggregates only. Pinned in Task 6 (README, `--help`) and Task 7.

### Task 1: done-gate claim detection (fixes false positives)
> Amendment (build): sentence-level '?' drop, negation only before the claim word, noun+complete and bullet forms — review found false negatives in the original heuristic. Final review: markdown decoration (`*`, `_`, `#`, leading `>`, bullets and emoji) is stripped before sentence splitting while backticks stay (so `**Done.**`, `## Done`, `> Done.` and `✅ Done` claim and inline code stays inert); `merged|shipped` joined the NOUN form and `has|have been merged|shipped|completed|finished` joined PAIR. Review round 2: negation is scoped to the claim's clause (clauses end at `, and`, `, but`, `, so`, ` - `, an em dash, or a sentence mark; bare commas do not split, so `Nothing, in short, is done.` stays a non-claim); PAIR accepts `I'm|I am|we're|we are [all|now] done|finished`; the question, table, fence and decoration guards each have a test that fails when the guard is deleted.


**Files:**
- Modify: `config/hooks/done-gate.sh:57` (the `if ! printf '%s' "$CLAIM_TEXT" | grep -qiE '\b(done|complete|finished|ready for review|merged|shipped)\b'` line)
- Test: `config/lib/tests/done-gate.test.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: bash function `is_done_claim <text>`. It returns 0 when the text claims completion and 1 otherwise. The hook calls it where the old regex was.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append these functions to `config/lib/tests/done-gate.test.sh`, before the list of test invocations at the bottom of the file, and add their names to that list:

```

- [x] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `bash config/lib/tests/done-gate.test.sh`

Expected: FAIL at `test_question_with_claim_word_is_not_a_claim` (the current regex matches "ready for review" inside the question, so the hook exits 2).

- [x] **Step 3: Implement `is_done_claim`**

In `config/hooks/done-gate.sh`, define the function before the `SESSION_ID=` line:

```bash
# A done claim is an assertion of completion, not any occurrence of a claim word.
# Ignored: fenced code and table rows. Sentences are split first, so a question
# ends at its own '?' ('All done. Should I open the PR?' still claims). A negation
# cancels a claim only when it appears before the claim word in the same clause,
# including any word the noun pattern consumed ('It is not finished.' is no claim;
# 'Nothing, in short, is done.' is no claim; 'Done, no issues found.' still claims).
# Deterministic: awk only (BSD awk, POSIX classes, no \b). \047 is a single quote.
is_done_claim() {
  printf '%s\n' "$1" | awk '
    BEGIN {
      NEG = "[^[:alpha:]](not|nothing|no|yet|never|none)[^[:alpha:]]|n\047t"
      START = "^[[:space:]]*([-*+]|[0-9]+[.)])?[[:space:]]*(done|finished|shipped|merged|ready for review)[^[:alpha:]\047]"
      B = "[^[:alpha:]\047]"

      NOUN = "[[:alpha:]]+[[:space:]]+(complete|completed|finished|ready for review)([[:space:]]*,|[.!;:]?[[:space:]]*$)"
      MID = B "(" PAIR B "|" NOUN ")"
      SEP = "\001"
      CLAUSE = ",[[:space:]]+(and|but|so)[[:space:]]|[[:space:]]+(-|\342\200\224)[[:space:]]+"

    function is_claim(s,   t, rest, acc, pre, m, seg) {
      if (s ~ /\?[[:space:]]*$/) return 0

      while (match(rest, MID)) {
        pre = acc substr(rest, 1, RSTART - 1)
        m = substr(rest, RSTART, RLENGTH)
        seg = " " pre " " m
        sub("^.*" SEP, "", seg)
        if (seg !~ NEG) return 1
        acc = acc substr(rest, 1, RSTART + RLENGTH - 1)
        rest = substr(rest, RSTART + RLENGTH)
      }
      return 0
    }
    /^[[:space:]]*```/ { f = !f; next }
    f { next }
    /^[[:space:]]*\|/ { next }
    {
      line = tolower($0)
      gsub(/[.!?;:][[:space:]]*/, "&\n", line)
      n = split(line, sent, "\n")
      for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) if (is_claim(sent[i])) found = 1
    }
    END { exit (found ? 0 : 1) }
  '
}
```

Replace the old line:

```bash
if ! printf '%s' "$CLAIM_TEXT" | grep -qiE '\b(done|complete|finished|ready for review|merged|shipped)\b'; then
```

with:

```bash
if ! is_done_claim "$CLAIM_TEXT"; then
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run all done-gate tests**

Run: `bash config/lib/tests/done-gate.test.sh && bash config/lib/tests/done-gate-annotate.test.sh`
Expected: every line `PASS: …`, exit 0. The existing tests (RF-2, RF-3, RF-4, the UI requirement tests) must still pass unchanged.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add config/hooks/done-gate.sh config/lib/tests/done-gate.test.sh
git commit -m "fix: done-gate detects completion claims, not bare claim words (questions, negations, tables, code ignored)"
```

### Task 2: judge `--providers` allowlist
> Amendment (build): final review found the allowlist only restricted the evaluate chain. `isProviderAllowed`, `gatePromptSortDeps` and `adjudicateRefusal` (in `providers-flag.ts`, unit-tested) now gate the direct calls: with an allowlist set, `prompt-sort` drops jev (falling back to its rules path) and its adjudicator unless `claude-cli` is allowed, and `adjudicate` exits 64 when `claude-cli` is not allowed. With no allowlist nothing changes. Review round 2: `judge eval` also checks `evalProviderRefusal` (exit 64 when the `--provider`, default jev, is not allowed). Every other direct provider call is either behind the restricted chain (`runQuestion`, `ui-element-repair`, `visual-critique`, `ask-check`) or is the adjudicate/prompt-sort gate above.

**Files:**
- Modify: `judge/src/chain.ts` (add `restrictChain`)
- Create: `judge/src/providers-flag.ts`
- Modify: `judge/src/config.ts:15` (`function isProviderName` → `export function isProviderName`)
- Modify: `judge/src/cli.ts:86` (`const chain = buildChain(...)`) and argv handling at `:95`
- Test: `judge/tests/chain.test.ts`, `judge/tests/providers-flag.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ChainSpec`, `buildChain` from `judge/src/chain.ts`; `ProviderName` from `judge/src/types.ts`; `isProviderName` from `judge/src/config.ts:15`. It is module-private today; this task adds `export`.
- Produces:
  - `restrictChain(spec: ChainSpec, allowed: readonly ProviderName[]): ChainSpec`
  - `parseProvidersAllowlist(argv: readonly string[], env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv): { ok: true; allowed: ProviderName[] | null; argv: string[] } | { ok: false; error: string }`
- Later plans: Sindri calls `judge --providers jev,claude-cli <cmd> ...`.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `judge/tests/chain.test.ts`:

```ts
describe("restrictChain", () => {
  it("keeps only allowed providers per class, always keeping rules as the last resort", async () => {
    const { buildChain, restrictChain } = await import("../src/chain.js");
    const chain = buildChain({ agentClis: ["claude-cli", "codex-cli"], jev: true });
    const restricted = restrictChain(chain, ["jev", "claude-cli"]);
    expect(restricted.classes.code).toEqual(["jev", "claude-cli", "rules"]);
    expect(restricted.classes.image).toEqual(["claude-cli", "rules"]);
  });

  it("leaves rules alone when the allowlist excludes every model provider", async () => {
    const { buildChain, restrictChain } = await import("../src/chain.js");
    const restricted = restrictChain(buildChain({ agentClis: ["codex-cli"], jev: true }), ["claude-cli"]);
    expect(restricted.classes.code).toEqual(["rules"]);
  });
});
```

Create `judge/tests/providers-flag.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

import { parseProvidersAllowlist } from "../src/providers-flag.js";

describe("parseProvidersAllowlist", () => {
  it("returns null allowlist and untouched argv when neither flag nor env is set", () => {
    expect(parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "why", "d1"], {})).toEqual({ ok: true, allowed: null, argv: ["node", "judge", "why", "d1"] });
  });

  it("parses --providers and strips it from argv wherever it appears", () => {
    expect(parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "--providers", "jev,claude-cli", "ask-check"], {})).toEqual({
      ok: true,
      allowed: ["jev", "claude-cli"],
      argv: ["node", "judge", "ask-check"],
    });
  });

  it("falls back to AW_JUDGE_PROVIDERS when the flag is absent", () => {
    expect(parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "health"], { AW_JUDGE_PROVIDERS: "jev" })).toEqual({ ok: true, allowed: ["jev"], argv: ["node", "judge", "health"] });
  });

  it("rejects unknown provider names instead of falling back to the full chain", () => {
    const r = parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "--providers", "jev,gpt5"], {});
    expect(r.ok).toBe(false);
  });

  it("rejects an empty list and a missing value", () => {
    expect(parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "--providers", ""], {}).ok).toBe(false);
    expect(parseProvidersAllowlist(["node", "judge", "--providers"], {}).ok).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

- [x] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd judge && npx vitest run tests/chain.test.ts tests/providers-flag.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL. `restrictChain` is not exported, and `../src/providers-flag.js` can't be resolved.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement**

Append to `judge/src/chain.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Limit a chain to an allowlist of providers (spec §6.1: providers.allowed).
 * "rules" is local and deterministic, so it is always kept as the last resort.
 */
export function restrictChain(spec: ChainSpec, allowed: readonly ProviderName[]): ChainSpec {
  const keep = new Set<ProviderName>([...allowed, "rules"]);
  const classes: Partial<Record<ContentClass, readonly ProviderName[]>> = {};
  for (const [cls, names] of Object.entries(spec.classes) as [ContentClass, readonly ProviderName[]][]) {
    classes[cls] = names.filter((n) => keep.has(n));
  }
  return { classes };
}
```

Create `judge/src/providers-flag.ts`:

```ts
import { isProviderName } from "./config.js";
import type { ProviderName } from "./types.js";

export type AllowlistResult = { ok: true; allowed: ProviderName[] | null; argv: string[] } | { ok: false; error: string };

// Global flag, accepted anywhere in argv so it composes with every subcommand:
//   judge --providers jev,claude-cli <cmd> ...
// AW_JUDGE_PROVIDERS is the env equivalent (hooks can't always add flags).
export function parseProvidersAllowlist(argv: readonly string[], env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv): AllowlistResult {
  const i = argv.indexOf("--providers");
  let raw: string | undefined;
  let rest = [...argv];
  if (i !== -1) {
    raw = argv[i + 1];
    if (raw === undefined) return { ok: false, error: "--providers needs a comma-separated list" };
    rest = [...argv.slice(0, i), ...argv.slice(i + 2)];
  } else if (env.AW_JUDGE_PROVIDERS !== undefined) {
    raw = env.AW_JUDGE_PROVIDERS;
  } else {
    return { ok: true, allowed: null, argv: rest };
  }
  const names = raw.split(",").map((s) => s.trim()).filter((s) => s.length > 0);
  if (names.length === 0) return { ok: false, error: "--providers list is empty" };
  const bad = names.filter((n) => !isProviderName(n));
  if (bad.length > 0) return { ok: false, error: `unknown provider(s): ${bad.join(", ")}` };
  return { ok: true, allowed: [...new Set(names as ProviderName[])], argv: rest };
}
```

In `judge/src/cli.ts`, add `restrictChain` to the import from `./chain.js` and import `parseProvidersAllowlist` from `./providers-flag.js`. Replace:

```ts
const chain = buildChain({ agentClis, jev: config.providers?.jev ?? true });
```

with:

```ts
const allowlist = parseProvidersAllowlist(process.argv, process.env);
if (!allowlist.ok) {
  console.error(`judge: ${allowlist.error}`);
  process.exit(64);
}
const fullChain = buildChain({ agentClis, jev: config.providers?.jev ?? true });
const chain = allowlist.allowed === null ? fullChain : restrictChain(fullChain, allowlist.allowed);
```

Then replace `const [, , cmd, ...rest] = process.argv;` with:

```ts
const [, , cmd, ...rest] = allowlist.argv;
```

Leave the `isHookSort` line (`cli.ts:39`) unchanged. It runs before the chain is built, and `prompt-sort` is never combined with `--providers`.

In `judge/src/config.ts:15`, change `function isProviderName` to `export function isProviderName`.

- [x] **Step 4: Run the judge suite and typecheck**

Run: `cd judge && npm run typecheck && npm test`
Expected: typecheck clean; all tests pass, including the 7 new ones.

### Task 3: `scorer audit`: human-turn extraction and pattern counts

> Amendment (build): skip parsed JSON values that are not objects (bare null crashed the extractor).

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/audit/human-turns.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/patterns.ts`
- Test: `scorer/tests/audit-human-turns.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-patterns.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `classifyUserText(raw: string): UserTextKind` from `scorer/src/transcript/classify.ts`.
- Produces:
  - `interface HumanTurn { project: string; session: string; ts: string; index: number; kind: "turn" | "command" | "interrupt"; text: string; skills: string[]; guardFiredBefore: boolean; compactedBefore: boolean; editsBefore: boolean; contextTokens: number; prevAssistantTail: string }`. `editsBefore` is true once an earlier main-chain assistant `tool_use` named `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` or `NotebookEdit` has been seen in the session (deterministic "after code was written"). `index` counts every turn in the file, copies included, so `session:index` stays stable after dedupe.
  - `extractHumanTurns(file: { path: string; project: string; sessionId: string }): AsyncGenerator<HumanTurn>`
  - `const PATTERNS: Readonly<Record<PatternName, RegExp>>`
  - `type PatternName = "ship_recipe" | "ci_conflicts" | "push_only" | "evidence_env" | "image_turn" | "handoff" | "restate" | "rigor" | "scope_surface" | "dispatch"` (`image_turn` counts `[Image #N]` attachments, not defects)
  - `countPatterns(turns: Iterable<HumanTurn>): Record<PatternName, { turns: number; sessions: number }>`

### Task 4: per-item token usage (quota baseline) and the items-share calculation

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/audit/usage.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/items.ts`
- Test: `scorer/tests/audit-usage.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-items.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `HumanTurn` from Task 3.
- Produces:
  - `sessionTokenTotals(path: string): Promise<{ input: number; cacheRead: number; cacheCreation: number; output: number }>`. It deduplicates assistant records by `message.id`, because Claude Code writes one line per content block with the same usage.
  - `itemIdsForSession(turns: readonly HumanTurn[], pattern: RegExp): string[]`: ids mentioned in the session's human turns, in first-seen order.
  - `summarizeItemUsage(perSession: { session: string; items: string[]; total: number; cacheRead: number }[]): { items: number; medianTokens: number; p75Tokens: number; medianCacheRead: number; p75CacheRead: number; byItem: Record<string, number> }`. A session's tokens are split evenly across the items it mentions. `total` is fresh tokens (input + cache writes + output), the quota proxy behind `medianTokens`/`p75Tokens`; `cacheRead` is split the same way and reported apart.
  - `interface ItemRecord { id: string; size?: "XS" | "S" | "M" | "L" | "XL"; ambiguous?: boolean; authorsTrusted?: boolean }`
  - `autoStartShare(items: readonly ItemRecord[], maxSize: ItemRecord["size"]): { eligible: number; total: number; share: number }`

### Task 5: `scorer audit` command, outputs and docs

> Amendment (build): (1) the per-item figure is fresh tokens (input + cache writes + output); cache reads dominated the sum and measured session length, so they are `usage.medianCacheRead`/`p75CacheRead`, reported apart in baseline.md. `summarizeItemUsage` takes `cacheRead` per session (Task 4 text updated). (2) The unreachable `?? "schema mismatch"` fallback in `readItems` is dropped (100% branch coverage). (3) The turn-file stream has an `error` handler and is destroyed if the loop throws, so write failures reject `runAudit`. (4) The README and usage text state that `--since` defaults to 1d. (5) Final review: `scorer audit --no-turns-file` (`CliOptions.turnsFile`, default true; `runAudit` option `turnsFile`) writes `summary.json` and `baseline.md` but no `human-turns.jsonl`, and combines with `--label` (labeling reads turns in memory). Usage text and the README document it.

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/audit/run-audit.ts`, `scripts/transcript-audit/README.md`
- Modify: `scorer/src/args.ts` (command union, flags), `scorer/src/cli.ts` (dispatch), `AGENTS.md` (Commands block)
- Test: `scorer/tests/audit-run.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/args.test.ts` (new cases)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `discoverFiles(projectsDir)` from `scorer/src/transcript/discover.ts`; Tasks 3–4 exports.
- Produces:
  - `runAudit(opts: { projectsDir: string; since: Date; outDir: string; itemPattern: RegExp; itemsFile: string | null; maxSize: Size }): Promise<AuditSummary>`. It keeps one `Set` of `` `${ts}\u0000${text}` `` across all files. A turn whose key was already seen is skipped (not written, not counted) and counted in `duplicates`. A turn with an empty `ts` is never deduped.
  - `interface AuditSummary { sessions: number; turns: number; commands: number; interrupts: number; duplicates: number; patterns: Record<PatternName, { turns: number; sessions: number }>; usage: { items: number; medianTokens: number; p75Tokens: number; medianCacheRead: number; p75CacheRead: number }; autoStart: { eligible: number; total: number; share: number } | null }`
  - Files written to `outDir`: `human-turns.jsonl`, `summary.json`, `baseline.md` (prints `duplicates`). Task 6 adds the optional label outputs.
  - `CliOptions` gains `command: "audit"`, plus `auditOut: string`, `itemPattern: string`, `itemsFile: string | null`, `maxSize: Size`.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `scorer/tests/args.test.ts`, the existing test `"defaults to a one-day report"` compares the full options object with `toEqual`. Add the four new defaults to its expected object:

```ts
      contextTokensPath: null, liveSession: null, liveCwd: null, liveWindow: 200_000, json: false,
      auditOut: "/home/j/.agentic-workflow/audit", itemPattern: "[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-\\d+", itemsFile: null, maxSize: "XS",
```

Then add these tests inside the top-level `describe("parseArgs", …)`, using the file's `NOW` and `HOME` constants:

```ts
it("parses the audit command with defaults", () => {
  const r = parseArgs(["audit"], NOW, HOME);
  expect(r.ok && r.options.command).toBe("audit");
  expect(r.ok && r.options.auditOut).toBe("/home/j/.agentic-workflow/audit");
  expect(r.ok && r.options.itemPattern).toBe("[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-\\d+");
  expect(r.ok && r.options.maxSize).toBe("XS");
});

it("rejects an invalid --max-size and an invalid --item-pattern", () => {
  expect(parseArgs(["audit", "--max-size", "XXL"], NOW, HOME).ok).toBe(false);
  expect(parseArgs(["audit", "--item-pattern", "("], NOW, HOME).ok).toBe(false);
});
```

In `scorer/src/args.ts`:
- Import `SIZES` and `Size` from `./audit/items.js`.
- Widen `command` to `"report" | "probe" | "context-tokens" | "live" | "audit"`.
- Add fields `auditOut: string; itemPattern: string; itemsFile: string | null; maxSize: Size;`.
- Default them in `options` to `auditOut: path.join(home, ".agentic-workflow", "audit")`, `itemPattern: "[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-\\d+"`, `itemsFile: null`, `maxSize: "XS"`.
- Add `if (arg === "audit") { options.command = "audit"; continue; }` next to the `live` branch.
- Add `"--out"`, `"--item-pattern"`, `"--items"` and `"--max-size"` to `VALUE_FLAGS`, and handle them:

```ts
if (arg === "--out") options.auditOut = value;
if (arg === "--items") options.itemsFile = value;
if (arg === "--item-pattern") {
  try {
    new RegExp(value);
  } catch {
    return { ok: false, error: `--item-pattern is not a valid regular expression: ${value}` };
  }
  options.itemPattern = value;
}
if (arg === "--max-size") {
  if (!(SIZES as readonly string[]).includes(value)) return { ok: false, error: `--max-size must be ${SIZES.join("|")}: ${value}` };
  options.maxSize = value as Size;
}
```

In `scorer/src/cli.ts`, add `import { runAudit } from "./audit/run-audit.js";` and a branch before the final `else`:

```ts
} else if (parsed.options.command === "audit") {
  const o = parsed.options;
  try {
    const s = await runAudit({ projectsDir: o.projectsDir, since: o.since, outDir: o.auditOut, itemPattern: new RegExp(o.itemPattern), itemsFile: o.itemsFile, maxSize: o.maxSize });
    console.log(`scorer audit: ${s.sessions} sessions, ${s.turns} turns → ${o.auditOut}/baseline.md`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`scorer audit: ${(e as Error).message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
```

Also extend the usage string in `cli.ts` with `| scorer audit [--since 60d; default 1d] [--out DIR] [--item-pattern RE] [--items FILE] [--max-size XS|S|M|L|XL]`.

Create `scripts/transcript-audit/README.md`:

# Transcript audit (Sindri rollout step 0)

Measures where human turns go across Claude Code transcripts and sets the baselines for Sindri's
success metrics (spec §2, §13 step 0).

```bash
(cd scorer && npm run build)
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d                 # → ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d --items items.json --max-size XS
```

`--since` defaults to `1d`; pass `60d` (or an ISO date) for a baseline window.

Outputs in `--out` (default `~/.agentic-workflow/audit/`):

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `human-turns.jsonl` | One record per human turn (`HumanTurn`): text, active skills, guard/compaction state, whether code was edited earlier in the session (`editsBefore`), context tokens, the preceding assistant message tail |
| `summary.json` | Session/turn counts, copied turns skipped (`duplicates`), per-pattern floor counts, fresh and cache-read tokens per item, auto-start share |
| `baseline.md` | Human-readable baseline table |

`items.json` (optional) is an array of `{ id, size?, ambiguous?, authorsTrusted? }`, from any tracker export or
triage output. Missing fields count as not eligible.

Resumed and forked sessions copy earlier human turns into the new transcript with the same timestamp. The audit
keeps one set of `(timestamp, text)` keys across all files and skips repeats (reported as `duplicates`). Turns with
no timestamp are never deduped.

Tokens per item split each session's usage evenly across the items it mentions. The primary figure is fresh
tokens (input + cache writes + output); cache-read tokens are reported separately because they grow with session
length. Both are a proxy for subscription quota, not the quota itself.

Patterns are deterministic floor counts, not labels, until calibrated with `--label` (below, added by the
calibration task). `image_turn` counts `[Image #N]` attachments, not defects.
```bash
(cd scorer && npm run build)
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d                 # → ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d --items items.json --max-size XS
```

Outputs in `--out` (default `~/.agentic-workflow/audit/`):

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `human-turns.jsonl` | One record per human turn (`HumanTurn`): text, active skills, guard/compaction state, whether code was edited earlier in the session (`editsBefore`), context tokens, the preceding assistant message tail |
| `summary.json` | Session/turn counts, copied turns skipped (`duplicates`), per-pattern floor counts, tokens per item, auto-start share |
| `baseline.md` | Human-readable baseline table |

`items.json` (optional) is an array of `{ id, size?, ambiguous?, authorsTrusted? }`, from any tracker export or
triage output. Missing fields count as not eligible.

Resumed and forked sessions copy earlier human turns into the new transcript with the same timestamp. The audit
keeps one set of `(timestamp, text)` keys across all files and skips repeats (reported as `duplicates`). Turns with
no timestamp are never deduped.

Patterns are deterministic floor counts, not labels, until calibrated with `--label` (below, added by the
calibration task). `image_turn` counts `[Image #N]` attachments, not defects.
````

In `AGENTS.md`, under the `# TypeScript packages` commands block, after the `scorer probe` line, add:

```bash
scorer audit [--since 60d; default 1d] [--items FILE] [--max-size XS]   # Human-turn baseline → ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run the scorer suite and typecheck**

Run: `cd scorer && npm run typecheck && npm test`
Expected: typecheck clean; all tests pass.

- [x] **Step 5: Run it against the real transcripts (evidence for the baseline)**

Run: `(cd scorer && npm run build) && node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d && sed -n 1,25p ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/baseline.md`
Expected: a non-empty table. The `push_only` and `ship_recipe` counts should be of the same order as the spec's appendix (about 85 and 189 over one month). Record the printed numbers in the PR description; they are step 0's floor counts (calibrated in Task 6, labeled in Task 7).

- [x] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add scorer/src/audit/run-audit.ts scorer/src/args.ts scorer/src/cli.ts scorer/tests/audit-run.test.ts scorer/tests/args.test.ts scripts/transcript-audit/README.md AGENTS.md
git commit -m "feat: scorer audit command (Sindri step 0 baselines)"
```

### Task 6: `scorer audit --label`: model-labeled calibration and wrong-approach measurement

> Amendment (build): `cli.ts` prints the `--help` text from the same `USAGE` constant; `labels.ts` sort comparator has no equal-hash branch; `labeling.ts` also `chmod`s `labels.jsonl` to 0600 (writeFileSync mode applies only on create); extra tests added for 100% coverage. Cleanup round: tag fence normalization (whitespace, zero-width, fullwidth, html entity) and the notice repeated after the last fence; `labelItems` keeps per-batch errors and aborts when the first two batches both fail; `labelerText` (1,500 chars) is shared by the prompt and calibration; `labels.jsonl` and `human-turns.jsonl` are chmod 0600 before any write (run-audit.ts too); cost line says up to 2x with retries; README documents `--safe-mode` and the env allowlist (no proxy or custom-CA vars). Round 2: a repeat-pass abort is caught in `runLabeling` (repeat reported as not compared with `repeat.abort` set, first-pass outputs still written; a first-pass abort still throws); fence gap set widened to `\p{Cf}` with the `u` flag and numeric entities (`&#60;`, `&#x3c;`, padded, any case) neutralized. Review round 3: labeler errors carry only a class and a short reason. `LabelerError` (fixed strings we wrote, original kept as `cause`) is thrown for envelope/result parse failures, schema and id mismatches and exec failures (`claude CLI not found`, `claude timed out`, `claude exited with code N`); `describeError` prints `LabelerError: <reason>` or just the error class for anything else, so a `JSON.parse` or zod message that quotes model output never reaches the abort message, `report.repeat.abort`, `baseline.md` or `calibration.json`.
A second user ran the spec's audit method on their own transcripts and had a model label every turn. Their
regexes had low recall (a correction pattern caught 5 of 45 wrong-approach corrections) and the image pattern
had low precision (22 real defects in 80 hits). So no pattern may feed a metric until it is checked against
adjudicator labels on a sample. This task adds that check, and measures how often wrong-approach corrections
happen, so the spec's step-0 decision rule (§13) can be applied.

**Files:**
- Create: `scorer/src/audit/stats.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/labels.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/claude-runner.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/calibrate.ts`, `scorer/src/audit/labeling.ts`
- Modify: `scorer/src/audit/run-audit.ts`, `scorer/src/args.ts`, `scorer/src/cli.ts`, `scripts/transcript-audit/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Test: `scorer/tests/audit-stats.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-labels.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-claude-runner.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-calibrate.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-labeling.test.ts`, `scorer/tests/audit-run.test.ts` (new cases), `scorer/tests/args.test.ts` (new cases)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `HumanTurn`, `PatternName`, `PATTERNS` (Task 3); `runAudit`, `AuditSummary` (Task 5).
- Produces:
  - `wilson(k: number, n: number): Interval` where `interface Interval { rate: number; lower: number; upper: number }` (95%, z = 1.96).
  - `const LABELS` and `type LabelName` (`wrong_approach_design | wrong_approach_process | defect_report | restate | rigor | scope_surface | ship_recipe | handoff | none`).
  - `type LabelRunner = (prompt: string, schema: object) => Promise<unknown>`
  - `interface LabelItem { id: string; prevAssistantTail: string; text: string }`
  - `const BATCH_SIZE = 20`, `const UNTRUSTED_NOTICE`
  - `turnKey(t: Pick<HumanTurn, "session" | "index">): string` (`"<session>:<index>"`)
  - `sampleTurns(turns: readonly HumanTurn[], n: number): HumanTurn[]`
  - `buildPrompt(batch: readonly LabelItem[]): string`, `outputJsonSchema(ids: readonly string[]): object`
  - `parseBatchOutput(raw: unknown, ids: readonly string[]): Map<string, LabelName[]>` (throws on any schema or id violation)
  - `labelItems(items: readonly LabelItem[], runner: LabelRunner): Promise<{ labels: Map<string, LabelName[]>; labelErrors: number }>`
  - `makeClaudeRunner(opts: { model: string; timeoutMs?: number; env?: NodeJS.ProcessEnv; exec?: ExecFn }): LabelRunner`, plus the pure helpers `claudeArgs`, `childEnv`, `extractStructured` and the thin `execClaude`.
  - `interface LabeledTurn { key: string; text: string; editsBefore: boolean; labels: readonly LabelName[] }`
  - `const PATTERN_LABEL` (pattern → label), `calibrate(labeled): PatternCalibration[]`, `estimateWrongApproach(labeled, totalTurns, windowDays): WrongApproachEstimate`, `repeatAgreement(first, second)`.
  - `interface LabelOptions { n: number; repeat: number; model: string; runner: LabelRunner; windowDays: number }`
  - `runLabeling(turns, totalTurns, opts, outDir): Promise<LabelingReport>`, `renderLabeling(report: LabelingReport | null): string[]`
  - `AuditSummary` gains `labeling: LabelingReport | null`; `runAudit` opts gain `label?: LabelOptions | undefined`.
  - `CliOptions` gains `label: number` (default 0 = off), `labelRepeat: number` (default 50), `labelModel: string` (default `"sonnet"`), `help: boolean`.
  - Files written to `outDir` only when `--label > 0`: `labels.jsonl` (one line per label: `{ key, labels, model, pass }`) and `calibration.json` (aggregate numbers, no turn text).

**Privacy:** labeling sends the text of the sampled turns (and the tail of the preceding assistant message) to the
model provider Claude Code already uses (the local `claude` login), through `claude -p --safe-mode`, so none of the
user's hooks, MCP servers or CLAUDE.md see it. The plain audit stays offline and free (`--label 0`). Everything is
written under `--out` (`~/.agentic-workflow/audit`), `human-turns.jsonl` and `labels.jsonl` owner-only (0600), and
nothing from them is ever committed or posted.

```

Modify `scorer/src/audit/run-audit.ts`:
- Import: `import type { LabelOptions, LabelingReport } from "./labeling.js";` and `import { renderLabeling, runLabeling } from "./labeling.js";`.
- `AuditSummary` gains `labeling: LabelingReport | null;`.
- `runAudit` opts gain `label?: LabelOptions | undefined`.
- In the `summary` object literal add `labeling: null,` after `autoStart: …`.
- Right after the object literal, before the `summary.json` write, add:

```ts
  if (opts.label !== undefined && opts.label.n > 0) {
    summary.labeling = await runLabeling(all, summary.turns, opts.label, opts.outDir);
  }
```

- In `renderBaseline`, add `...renderLabeling(s.labeling),` as the last element of the returned array, after `` `Auto-start share: ${auto}.`, ``, ``  `` and before the closing `].join("\n")`.

Modify `scorer/src/args.ts`:
- `CliOptions` gains `label: number; labelRepeat: number; labelModel: string; help: boolean;`.
- Defaults: `label: 0, labelRepeat: 50, labelModel: "sonnet", help: false`.
- Next to `--json`: `if (arg === "--help" || arg === "-h") { options.help = true; continue; }`
- Add `"--label"`, `"--label-repeat"`, `"--label-model"` to `VALUE_FLAGS` and handle them:

```ts
if (arg === "--label" || arg === "--label-repeat") {
  const count = Number(value);
  if (!/^\d+$/.test(value) || !Number.isSafeInteger(count)) return { ok: false, error: `${arg} must be a non-negative integer: ${value}` };
  if (arg === "--label") options.label = count;
  else options.labelRepeat = count;
}
if (arg === "--label-model") {
  if (!/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:[\]-]*$/.test(value)) return { ok: false, error: `--label-model must be a model name or alias: ${value}` };
  options.labelModel = value;
}
```

Modify `scorer/src/cli.ts`. Add `import { makeClaudeRunner } from "./audit/claude-runner.js";`. Replace the inline usage string with a `USAGE` constant used for both the parse-error path and `--help`:

```ts
const USAGE = [
  "usage: scorer live --session ID [--cwd DIR] [--window TOKENS] [--json]",
  "       scorer [probe] [--since 7d|12h|ISO] [--provider claude|codex|cursor|all] [--projects-dir DIR] [--codex-dir DIR] [--cursor-dir DIR] [--state-dir DIR] [--no-pr-lookup]",
  "       scorer audit [--since 60d; default 1d] [--out DIR] [--item-pattern RE] [--items FILE] [--max-size XS|S|M|L|XL] [--label N] [--label-repeat K] [--label-model MODEL]",
  "",
  "audit --label N (default 0 = off, fully offline) has a model label N sampled human turns to calibrate the regex patterns",
  "and measure wrong-approach corrections. It sends the text of those turns (and the tail of the preceding assistant message)",
  "to the model provider your Claude Code login already uses, one `claude -p` call per 20 turns plus ceil(K/20) repeat calls (up to 2x with retries).",
  "Everything is written under --out (default ~/.agentic-workflow/audit); never commit labels.jsonl or human-turns.jsonl.",
].join("\n");
```

Print it with `console.error(USAGE)` on a parse error, and handle help right after parsing succeeds: `if (parsed.options.help) { console.log(USAGE); process.exit(0); }`. Replace the `audit` branch with:

```ts
} else if (parsed.options.command === "audit") {
  const o = parsed.options;
  try {
    const label =
      o.label > 0
        ? { n: o.label, repeat: o.labelRepeat, model: o.labelModel, runner: makeClaudeRunner({ model: o.labelModel }), windowDays: (o.until.getTime() - o.since.getTime()) / 86_400_000 }
        : undefined;
    const s = await runAudit({ projectsDir: o.projectsDir, since: o.since, outDir: o.auditOut, itemPattern: new RegExp(o.itemPattern), itemsFile: o.itemsFile, maxSize: o.maxSize, label });
    console.log(`scorer audit: ${s.sessions} sessions, ${s.turns} turns, ${s.duplicates} copied turns skipped → ${o.auditOut}/baseline.md`);
    if (s.labeling !== null) console.log(`scorer audit: labeled ${s.labeling.labeled}/${s.labeling.sampled} sampled turns, ${s.labeling.labelErrors} failed batches`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`scorer audit: ${(e as Error).message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
```

Append to `scripts/transcript-audit/README.md` (before the closing of the file; this is a new section):

````markdown
## Calibrating the patterns (`--label`)

The regex patterns are floor counts until they are checked against labels from a model adjudicator. On a second
user's transcripts a correction pattern caught 5 of 45 wrong-approach corrections, and 22 of 80 image turns were
real defects. So no metric may use a pattern until calibration marks it `metric-grade`.

```bash
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d --label 400                 # 20 labeler calls + 3 repeat calls
node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 60d --label 400 --label-repeat 50 --label-model sonnet
```

- **Sample.** `--label n` takes n deduped typed turns, ordered by sha256 of `session:index` (uniform and reproducible).
  `--label 0` (the default) skips labeling, so the plain audit stays offline and free.
- **Labeler.** `claude -p --safe-mode` with no tools, no MCP servers and no session file, in batches of 20 turns.
  `--safe-mode` means no hooks, CLAUDE.md, MCP servers or plugins see the turn text. The child gets only PATH, HOME, USER
  and the Claude auth variables; proxy and custom-CA variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and the like) are
  not passed, so behind a proxy or custom CA the calls fail. Turn text is fenced as untrusted data (tag spellings with
  spaces, zero-width characters, fullwidth brackets and html entities are neutralized, and the rule is repeated after
  the last fence), the output is schema-validated, and a bad batch is retried once, then counted in `labelErrors`. If
  the first two batches both fail (missing CLI, not logged in), the run aborts with that error. Calibration tests the
  patterns against the same first 1,500 characters the labeler saw.
  Labels: `wrong_approach_design`, `wrong_approach_process`, `defect_report`, `restate`, `rigor`, `scope_surface`,
  `ship_recipe`, `handoff`, `none` (exclusive).
- **Repeat.** `--label-repeat k` (default 50) relabels the first k sampled turns with batches in reverse order and reports
  raw agreement per label.
- **Calibration.** Each pattern is compared with its label (`restate`, `rigor`, `scope_surface`, `ship_recipe`, `handoff`,
  and `image_turn` against `defect_report`): TP, FP, FN, precision and recall with Wilson 95% lower bounds. `metric-grade`
  needs both lower bounds at least 0.6 and at least 10 positives; anything else is `floor only`.
- **Wrong-approach corrections.** Design and process counts in the sample, their share of turns with a Wilson interval,
  scaled to all deduped turns, restricted to turns after code was written (`editsBefore`), and per 30 days. The spec's
  step-0 decision rule reads the design number: under 8 per 30 days after code means Approach and Drift direction checks
  are not built in 3a (not even in shadow).

Extra outputs: `labels.jsonl` (turn key, labels, model, pass) and `calibration.json`; `baseline.md` gains the
"Pattern calibration" and "Wrong-approach corrections" sections. Without `--label`, `baseline.md` says
"Patterns are uncalibrated floor counts; run with --label 400 to calibrate."

**Privacy.** Labeling sends the text of the sampled turns, and the tail of the preceding assistant message, to the
model provider Claude Code already uses (your local `claude` login). The same notice is in `scorer audit --help`.
All outputs stay under `~/.agentic-workflow/audit`. Never commit `labels.jsonl` or `human-turns.jsonl`; PR comments
carry aggregate numbers only.

**Cost.** n = 400 is 20 labeler calls (400 / 20) plus 3 repeat calls (50 / 20, rounded up), 23 in all (up to 2x with retries).
````

In `AGENTS.md`, replace the `scorer audit` line from Task 5 with:

```bash
scorer audit [--since 60d; default 1d] [--items FILE] [--max-size XS] [--label N]   # Human-turn baseline → ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/; --label sends sampled turn text to your Claude login's provider
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run the scorer suite and typecheck**

Run: `cd scorer && npm run typecheck && npm test`
Expected: typecheck clean; all tests pass, including the new stats, labels, runner, calibration, labeling, args and run cases.

- [x] **Step 5: Check the offline path and the help text (no model calls)**

Run: `(cd scorer && npm run build) && node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --since 7d --out "$(mktemp -d)" && node scorer/dist/cli.js audit --help | grep -c "model provider your Claude Code login"`
Expected: the audit prints its summary line and writes no `labels.jsonl`; the grep prints `1`. The real labeled run happens once, in Task 7.

- [x] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add scorer/src/audit/stats.ts scorer/src/audit/labels.ts scorer/src/audit/claude-runner.ts scorer/src/audit/calibrate.ts scorer/src/audit/labeling.ts scorer/src/audit/run-audit.ts scorer/src/args.ts scorer/src/cli.ts scorer/tests/audit-stats.test.ts scorer/tests/audit-labels.test.ts scorer/tests/audit-claude-runner.test.ts scorer/tests/audit-calibrate.test.ts scorer/tests/audit-labeling.test.ts scorer/tests/audit-run.test.ts scorer/tests/args.test.ts scripts/transcript-audit/README.md AGENTS.md

### Task 7: Turn it on (bootstrapping ladder, spec §13.3)
> Amendment (build): the installer loop iterates over full plist filenames (`PLIST_NAME`) rather than a bare `NAME`, so the literal `com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist` that the Step 1 test greps for appears in `install-scorer.sh`. The cron hint escapes `$(date +%F)` (`\$(date +%F)`) so the printed cron line expands the date at run time, not install time. Final review: the weekly job command (launchd plist, cron hint, and the install test's expected string) includes `--no-turns-file`, so the weekly job keeps no verbatim turn copies. Review round 2: the printed cron hint escapes the percent sign as `\%F` (an unescaped `%` ends a crontab command); the launchd plist keeps `%F`.


Plan 1's pieces start working on the rest of the Sindri build as soon as this PR merges. This task adds the
one missing switch, a weekly audit, and records the switch-on evidence. Steps 1–5 run on the PR branch.
Step 6 runs **after merge** and its output is posted as a PR comment.

**Files:**
- Create: `config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist`
- Modify: `scripts/install-scorer.sh` (install both plists)
- Test: `scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh`
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` (add the new bash test to the Commands list)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `scorer audit` command (Tasks 5 and 6).
- Produces: a weekly unlabeled job writing `~/.agentic-workflow/audit/weekly/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`. Later plans' "Turn it on" tasks read it to show steering turns per merged Sindri PR going down.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
ROOT="$DIR/../.."
PLIST="$ROOT/config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist"

test_plist_exists_and_is_valid() {
  [ -f "$PLIST" ] || { echo "FAIL: $PLIST missing"; exit 1; }
  if command -v plutil >/dev/null 2>&1; then plutil -lint "$PLIST" >/dev/null || { echo "FAIL: plist invalid"; exit 1; }; fi
  echo "PASS: test_plist_exists_and_is_valid"
}

test_plist_runs_weekly_audit_into_dated_dir() {
  grep -q 'scorer audit --since 7d --label 0 --out __HOME__/.agentic-workflow/audit/weekly/$(date +%F)' "$PLIST" || { echo "FAIL: audit command missing"; exit 1; }
  grep -q '<key>Weekday</key>' "$PLIST" || { echo "FAIL: not weekly"; exit 1; }
  echo "PASS: test_plist_runs_weekly_audit_into_dated_dir"
}

test_installer_installs_both_plists() {
  grep -q 'com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist' "$ROOT/scripts/install-scorer.sh" || { echo "FAIL: installer does not install the audit plist"; exit 1; }
  echo "PASS: test_installer_installs_both_plists"
}

test_plist_exists_and_is_valid
test_plist_runs_weekly_audit_into_dated_dir
test_installer_installs_both_plists
```

- [x] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `bash scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh`
Expected: `FAIL: …/com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist missing`

- [x] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/bin/bash</string>
    <string>-lc</string>
    <string>__HOME__/.local/bin/scorer audit --since 7d --label 0 --out __HOME__/.agentic-workflow/audit/weekly/$(date +%F)</string>
  </array>
  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>

  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
  <string>__HOME__/.agentic-workflow/scorer/audit-launchd.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

In `scripts/install-scorer.sh`, replace the single-plist block inside the `Darwin` branch with a loop over both
plists, keeping the existing `bootout`/`bootstrap` calls and messages:

```bash
    for PLIST_NAME in com.agentic-workflow.scorer.plist com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist; do
      PLIST_SRC="$SCRIPT_DIR/config/launchd/$PLIST_NAME"
      PLIST_DST="$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR/$PLIST_NAME"
      sed "s|__HOME__|$HOME|g" "$PLIST_SRC" > "$PLIST_DST"
      launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)" "$PLIST_DST" 2>/dev/null || true
      launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" "$PLIST_DST"
    done
    echo "  scorer: daily report at 08:30 and weekly audit Mondays 08:45 (launchd)"
```

Keep the `mkdir -p "$LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR" "${AW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.agentic-workflow}/scorer"` line before the loop.
In the non-Darwin `else` branch, extend the cron hint with:
`45 8 * * 1 $BIN_DIR/scorer audit --since 7d --label 0 --out $HOME/.agentic-workflow/audit/weekly/$(date +%F)`. The weekly job stays unlabeled (`--label 0`): it is free and offline. A labeled run is a deliberate, monthly step (spec §13 step 0).

In `AGENTS.md`'s bash test list, add `bash scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh`.

- [x] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `bash scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh && ./setup.sh --providers claude,codex,cursor --dry-run > /dev/null && echo SETUP_DRY_RUN_OK`
Expected: three `PASS` lines, then `SETUP_DRY_RUN_OK`.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add config/launchd/com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit.plist scripts/install-scorer.sh scripts/tests/install-scorer-audit.test.sh AGENTS.md
git commit -m "feat: weekly scorer audit job (Sindri bootstrapping ladder)"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Switch on after merge, then post the evidence as a PR comment**

Run on Joi's machine, after the PR merges, from the updated `main`:

```bash
scripts/install-done-gate.sh --provider claude                 # live hook copy now has claim detection
scripts/install-scorer.sh                                       # installs the CLI + daily + weekly jobs
launchctl list | grep com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit         # weekly job loaded
scorer audit --since 60d --label 400                            # one-time labeled baseline: 20 labeler calls + 3 repeat calls
sed -n 1,90p ~/.agentic-workflow/audit/baseline.md
```

Expected:
- `install-done-gate.sh` reports success.
- `launchctl list` shows `com.agentic-workflow.scorer-audit`.
- `baseline.md` holds the step-0 baseline table, a "Pattern calibration" table (each pattern `metric-grade` or `floor only`) and a "Wrong-approach corrections" section ending in the decision-rule line.

The labeled run sends the 400 sampled turns to the model provider your Claude Code login already uses (see the
README). Post **aggregate numbers only**: the tables from `baseline.md`, the `metric-grade` / `floor only` verdicts,
the repeat-agreement line and the decision-rule line. If the decision line says the interval straddles 8, re-run with a
larger `--label` (for example `--label 1500`, which costs about 75 labeler calls) and post that result instead. Never post, attach or commit `labels.jsonl`,
`human-turns.jsonl` or any turn text.

Post all of that as a comment on the Plan 1 PR. From this point the Plan 2 build sessions run with the
fixed done-gate, and their steering turns are measured weekly. That's ladder rows 1–3 in spec §13.3.

## Done criteria for this plan
> Deferred to Plan 2 (build): the audit does not yet count done-gate blocks, so spec §13's done-gate success signal ("false-positive rate in the next weekly audit drops to ~0") is not measured yet.
- Merge gate (AGENTS.md) green for `judge` and `scorer`: `npm run typecheck` + `npm test` in each. The done-gate bash tests pass.
- `scorer audit --since 60d --label 400` produces `baseline.md` with pattern calibration and the wrong-approach section on the real corpus, and the aggregate numbers are recorded in the PR.
- Every new test from Review Focus 1–9 is present and passing.
- **Switched on (Task 7, Step 6):** the live done-gate is reinstalled, the weekly (unlabeled) audit job is loaded, and the labeled baseline, calibration table and wrong-approach numbers are recorded as an aggregate-only PR comment. The decision-rule outcome (whether Approach and Drift direction checks are built in 3a) is recorded in the same comment. Plan 2 must not start until this evidence is posted (spec §13.3 rules).
