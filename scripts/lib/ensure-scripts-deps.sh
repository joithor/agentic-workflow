# scripts/lib/ensure-scripts-deps.sh — ensure_scripts_deps [DIR]: make sure scripts/'s dev dependencies (Ajv, from
# scripts/package.json) are installed in DIR/node_modules (default: this repo's scripts/). Source it; it defines
# functions only and sets no options. Used by the suites that run scripts/check-launcher.mjs and check-fleet.mjs.
#
# bash-tests.sh runs suites in parallel in one tree, so two of them can need the install at once. One `npm ci` runs
# at a time under a lock directory (mkdir is atomic, and works on macOS, which has no flock); a caller that finds the
# lock waits for it, then sees the finished install and returns. The fast path is Ajv resolving from DIR, not only
# its directory existing, so a half-written install from another caller is never taken as done.
# Returns 0 when Ajv resolves, 1 (with one line on stderr) when the install fails or the lock is held past ~5 min.
