# aw:context-guard — PostToolUse hook (lever 2B). Measures the current
# transcript's context size and, past a threshold, nudges the agent to write
# a handoff digest. Fails open unconditionally: on any error, prints nothing
# and exits 0. Never blocks a tool call — it can only add additionalContext.
#
# Cost discipline (2026-09-27 review): this fires on EVERY tool call in
# EVERY session on the box (matcher .*). It must never spawn Node — no
# `scorer` subprocess here (that stays the scorer report's own accurate,
# TypeScript-tested path). A byte-growth gate skips the real check unless the
# transcript has grown enough since the last real check to plausibly matter.
#
# Latency fix (2026-09-27, review #2): the skip path (the common case, run on
# EVERY tool call) was measured at ~68ms median, mostly one `jq` process per
# field plus a config-file read. It now does exactly one subprocess (a single
# `jq -r` producing both fields it needs in one call — a bash builtin
# read+regex extraction was considered but real hook input can carry
# arbitrary tool_input/tool_response content that may itself contain a
# `"transcript_path":"..."` or `"session_id":"..."` substring, which a
# builtin regex match can't safely disambiguate from the top-level field;
# jq's structured `.transcript_path`/`.session_id` access has no such risk),
# one `stat`/`wc` file-size read, a `read` builtin against the state file (no
# `cat`), and one arithmetic comparison. The growth-gate threshold itself is
# a constant (default 20000 bytes, override via
# AW_CONTEXT_GUARD_GROWTH_GATE_BYTES) rather than read from config.json on
# this path — config.json (thresholdTokens, growthGateBytes) is read only
# once the growth gate has already been cleared, on the full-check path.
#
# Blocker fix (2026-09-27, review #1): a real message.usage object is NOT
# flat — its key order is input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens,
# cache_read_input_tokens, output_tokens, then several NESTED objects
# (output_tokens_details{...}, server_tool_use{...}, cache_creation{...},
# ...). The original fast path (`grep -oE '"usage":\{[^}]*\}'`) stops at the
# first nested "}" and never matches a real usage object, so it always
# failed silently. The fix greps for the last complete "assistant" line
# (not a byte-window `tail`, which can miss it once a large tool_result
# follows) and lets jq parse that whole JSON line directly.
